                    1.3.5 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.5 release cycle, from the 1.3.5rc1 release to the 1.3.5 maintenance
releases.  More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and
ChangeLog files.

1.3.5rc2
---------

  + New Modules

    mod_log_forensic
      The mod_log_forensic module ...
      See doc/contrib/mod_log_forensic.html for more information.

    mod_rlimit
      Same RLimitCPU, RLimitMemory, RLimitOpenFiles directives
      New setting of RLIMIT_NPROC (unless mod_exec.c/ExecEngine on)


  + New Configuration Directives

    GeoIPPolicy (Bug#3860)

    SQLLogOnEvent (Bug#3893)

    TLSMasqueradeAddress (Bug#3862)

    TLSUserName (Bug#3899)


  + Changed Configuration Directives

    AuthUserFile, AuthGroupFile (Bug#3892)
      No world-readable/world-writable files, no world-writable parent dir

    HiddenStores (Bug#3872)

    LogFormat (Bug#3889)
      %{iso8601}
      %{microsecs}
      %{millisecs}

    TLSProtocol (Bug#3891)

    TLSSessionCache (Bug#3869)


  + Logging Format changes

    Note that the logging format for SystemLog, TraceLog, and all per-module
    log files has changed.  Specifically, the log lines now have an ISO-8601
    timestamp format, so that they now look like:

      2013-01-31 15:33:03,832

    instead of:

      Jan 31 15:33:03

    The new format does not use textual month abbreviations, and includes
    milliseconds in the timestamp.


1.3.5rc1
---------

  + Added support for SHA-256, SHA-512 password hashes to the ftpasswd tool
  + Many mod_sftp bugfixes
  + Added Japanese and Spanish translations

  + New Modules

    mod_geoip
      The mod_geoip module provides lookup of geographic information based
      on the IP address of the connecting client.  This information can
      be logged, and used to drop the connection if necessary.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_geoip.html for complete information.


  + Changed Modules

    mod_sftp
      The mod_sftp module now supports use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography
      (ECC).  This includes ECDSA host keys and user keys, and the ECDH
      key exchange method.

      Improved FIPS support in mod_sftp.

      The mod_sftp module now honors the MaxStoreFileSize directive.


  + New Configuration Directives:

    AllowChrootSymlinks
      By default, when chrooting a process (via the DefaultRoot directive
      or for <Anonymous> logins), proftpd will follow a symlink.  Some sites
      wish to restrict this; for these sites, there is the new
      AllowChrootSymlinks directive.  See
      doc/modules/mod_auth.html#AllowChrootSymlinks for details.

    CapabilitiesRootRevoke
      The mod_cap module now completely drops root privileges; the retained
      Linux capabilities should suffice.  To revert to the previous behavior,
      use this new CapabilitiesRootRevoke directive; see
      doc/modules/mod_cap.html#CapabilitiesRootRevoke.

    <IfAuthenticated>
      There are times when a site might wish to have directives that apply
      <b>only</b> to sessions once the user has been authenticated, and not
      before then.  The mod_ifsession module now provides this ability via
      the <IfAuthenticated> section; see
      doc/contrib/mod_ifsession.html#IfAuthenticated.

    FactsOptions
      The FactsOptions directive is used to tweak the outputs used by
      the mod_facts module for the MLSD/MLST output.  One such option is
      UseSlink, which provides better compatibility with the output expected
      e.g. by FileZilla.  The doc/modules/mod_facts.html#FactsOptions
      description has more details.

    QuotaDefault
      The QuotaDefault directive is used to provide a "default" quota,
      via the mod_quotatab module, if mod_quotatab is unable to find a
      quota for the logging-in user.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_quotatab.html#QuotaDefault for details.

    RewriteMaxReplace
      The RewriteMaxReplace directive is used to change the number of
      replacements that mod_rewrite will do when rewriting commands.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteMaxReplace for more details.

    TLSServerCipherPreference
      This directive can be used to configure mod_tls so that the server
      ciphersuites are preferred, rather than preferring the client
      ciphersuites.  See doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSServerCipherPreference
      for more information.


  + Changed Configuration Directives

    AllowFilter, DenyFilter
      The "[NC]" (or "[nocase]") case-insensitive flags for the PathAllowFilter
      and PathDenyFilter directives have now been extended to apply to the
      AllowFilter and DenyFilter directives as well.  For example:

        AllowFilter \.html [NC]
        DenyFilter \.jpg$ [nocase]

    CreateHome
      When creating a home directory via the CreateHome directive, proftpd
      will automatically use root privileges, in order to create the
      necessary directories with configured ownership and permissions.
      However, for some sites which use e.g. NFS, use of root privileges
      will cause problems.  For such situations, the CreateHome directive
      now supports a NoRootPrivs parameter; see doc/howto/CreateHome.html
      for examples.

    ListOptions
      The mod_ls module now supports the -1 option (list one file per line),
      which can also be configured via the ListOptions directive.

      The ListOptions directive now supports new "LISTOnly" and "NLSTOnly"
      keywords, for applying the restrictions only to the LIST (or NLST)
      FTP commands.

    LogFormat
      The LogFormat directive can now handle logging variables of the format
      %{note:<name>}, where <name> refers to an internal "note" name.  The
      supported names vary depending on the various modules.  In most cases,
      these note names are not useful for general purpose logging, however.

    RewriteCondition, RewriteRule
      The RewriteCondition and RewriteRule directives of the mod_rewrite
      module now support time-related variables; see
      doc/contrib/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteCondition for more information.

    RootRevoke
      The RootRevoke directive now supports a "UseNonCompliantActiveTransfers"
      parameter, for dropping root privileges BUT still allowing active
      data transfers by using a non-standard source port for the active
      transfer.  See doc/modules/mod_auth.html#RootRevoke for more information.

    ScoreboardFile
      Some sites have found that maintaining the ScoreboardFile can lead to
      a fair amount of overhead.  Those sites who wish to remove this overhead
      can now disable use of the ScoreboardFile altogether by using:

        ScoreboardFile off

      Note that doing so means that certain configuration directives (e.g.
      MaxClients) and certain tools (e.g. ftptop, ftpwho, ftpcount) will no
      longer work.  See doc/modules/mod_core.html#ScoreboardFile for details.

    ServerIdent
      The ServerIdent directive is now honored by the mod_sftp module.
      For example, you can configure mod_sftp to not provide any version
      information at all, or to provide a different server name/token
      altogether; see doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPVersionId.

    SFTPDigests
      The SFTPDigests directive (see doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPDigests)
      now handles/supports the SHA-256 and SHA-512 digest algorithms.

    SFTPHostKey
      The mod_sftp module can now load its host keys from an SSH agent
      process such as OpenSSH ssh-agent(1) tool; see
      doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPHostKey for details.

    SFTPOptions
      To prevent users from changing the ownership of their files via SFTP,
      the SFTPOptions directive (doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPOptions) now
      supports an IgnoreSFTPSetOwners parameter.

    SocketOptions
      The SocketOptions directive (see doc/modules/mod_core.html#SocketOptions)
      now supports a new "keepalive" parameter, for tuning the TCP keepalive
      behavior.  A more detailed explanation of TCP keepalives, and other
      forms of keepalive, is provided in doc/howto/KeepAlives.html.

    SQLLog, LogFormat
      The LogFormat and SQLLog directives support two new logging variables:
      %{transfer-status} and %{transfer-failure}.  The %{transfer-status}
      variable indicates the status of a data transfer: "success", "failed",
      "cancelled", "timeout", or "-" (if not applicable).  The
      %{transfer-failure} variable indicates the reason for the data transfer
      failure, or "-" if there was no failure.

    SystemLog
      The SystemLog can now be disabled via <IfClass>, e.g. for disabling
      logging for specific clients.

    TLSCipherSuite
      The default SSL/TLS ciphersuites offered/used by mod_tls have changed
      from "ALL:!ADH" to a more secure ordering of "DEFAULT:!ADH:!EXPORT:!DES".

    TLSProtocol
      When compiled using OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later, the TLSProtocol directive
      can be used to specify TLS versionf "TLSv1.1" and "TLSv1.2".

    UseEncoding
      When the UseEncoding directive (doc/modules/mod_lang.html#UseEncoding)
      is used to specify encodings, it used to require that the client use
      these encodings, and not allow clients to request different encodings.
      This requirement is now related.  To preserve the old behavior, a
      new "strict" keyword is supported; the directive documentation covers
      this in more details.

    <VirtualHost>, MasqueradeAddress, DefaultAddress
      All of these directives can now take an interface name, in addition
      to DNS names or IP addresses, to be resolved to an IP address.  This
      is useful in cases where the same proftpd.conf needs to be deployed or
      shared across a cluster; each machine has the same interface name which
      handles different IP addresses.

      Examples:

        DefaultAddress lo0
        MasqueradeAddress eth0

        <VirtualHost eth0>
          ...
        </VirtualHost>


  + Changed Command Handling

    PORT/EPRT
      When handling PORT and EPRT FTP commands from clients, proftpd now
      checks for RFC 1918 addresses in those commands; these are non-publicly
      routable IP addresses, and should NOT be being sent by clients.  When
      proftpd detects these RFC1918 addresses being used for a WAN server
      address, then proftpd will ignore the RFC1918 address, and instead
      use the IP address of the connecting client.  This change should help
      interoperability of data transfers for some FTP clients.


  + API Changes

    The session.class struct member has been renamed to session.conn_class.
    This was done to allow for support of C++ modules.  Similarly, the
    cmd_rec.class struct member has been renamed to cmd_rec.cmd_class,
    and cmdtable.class renamed to cmdtable.cmd_class.  See Bug#3079 for
    details.
