                    1.2.10 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.2.10 release cycle, from the 1.2.10rc1 release to the 1.2.10-stable release.
More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and ChangeLog
files.


NOTES
-----
  When upgrading to 1.2.10rc1, please take note of the following:

  + The new Class support will require changes to proftpd.conf files that
    use the old Class/Classes directives.  See README.classes for details.

1.2.10-final
---------
  + Better support for AIX5

  + Enhanced configuration directives:
      AuthOrder

    Since various *Authoritative directives are deprecated, yet the
    authoritativeness functionality is still needed (e.g. when using PAM),
    the AuthOrder directive has been enhanced to support marking a
    module's auth response as required.

    For example, to use the standard /etc/passwd file for authentication
    and to refuse to authenticate users who fail PAM checks, one would
    use:

      AuthOrder mod_auth_pam.c* mod_auth_unix.c

    The trailing '*' after mod_auth_pam signals that the PAM checks are
    to be honored.  Without the '*', mod_auth_pam could fail to
    authenticate the user, but if mod_auth_unix successfully authenticated
    the user, the login would be allowed.

1.2.10rc2
---------
  + New configuration directives:
      TimeoutLinger

    If a client aborts a connection, proftpd will wait, or "linger", for
    a small amount of time before closing the socket, in order to handle
    any data that might still be in the network.  By default, this
    amount of time is 3 minutes.  For sites that experience this delay,
    the new TimeoutLinger directive can be used to configured a shorter
    delay.

1.2.10rc1
---------
  + Support for Mac OSX 10.3.3

  + New configuration directives:
      <Class>
      AllowClass
      DenyClass
      MaxClientsPerClass
      SetEnv
      UnsetEnv

  + Enhanced configuration directives:
      The Include configuration directive now functions similarly to
      Apache's Include directive, able to include all files within a
      given directory, or only those files that match a simple glob
      pattern.

  + Deprecated configuration directives:
      AuthPAMAuthoritative
      Class
      Classes

  + New configuration file variable:
      Using "%{env:<var>}" in your proftpd.conf will cause the string
      to be replaced with the value of the named environment variable.
      For example:

        DefaultAddress ${env:PR_DEFAULT_ADDR}

      would be expanded to:

        DefaultAddress 127.0.0.1

      assuming the PR_DEFAULT_ADDR environment variable value was
      "127.0.0.1".

  + New programs:
      The ftpdctl program, which can be used to communicate with the
      running daemon using Unix domain sockets.  See README.controls for
      more information.

  + New modules:
      mod_quotatab, a collection of modules related to quota management.
      See contrib/mod_quotatab.html

      mod_ctrls_admin, a module implementing various administrative
      ftpdctl commands.  See contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html and
      README.controls.

      mod_site_misc, a module implementing commonly used SITE commands.
      See contrib/mod_site_misc.html

  + Enhanced modules:
      The mod_tls module can now handle passphrase-protected certificates

  + Documentation
     The doc/howto directory contains a collection of useful HOWTOs for
     ProFTPD users.

     The doc/modules directory contains HTML documentation for some of
     ProFTPD's optional modules (e.g. mod_cap, mod_ctrls).
