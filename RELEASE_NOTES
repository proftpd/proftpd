                    1.3.6 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.6 release cycle, from the 1.3.6rc1 release to the 1.3.6 maintenance
releases.  More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and
ChangeLog files.

1.3.6rc3
---------

  + mod_sftp uses SHA256 for publickey fingerprints by default, rather than
    SHA1 or MD5.
  + mod_sql_passwd supports Scrypt and Argon2 password hashing algorithms
    when built using libsodium.
  + mod_sftp now supports extended attributes (xattrs) via SFTP.

  
  + New Configuration Directives:

    FSOptions IgnoreExtendedAttributes

    SFTPKeyLimits (Bug#4233)

    SQLPasswordCost (Bug#4154)


  + Changed Configuration Directives:

    MasqueradeAddress
      The MasqueradeAddress directive is now allowed in <Global> sections,
      to ease configuration for name-based virtual hosts.

    SFTPKeyExchanges
      The mod_sftp module now supports the "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org"
      SSH key exchange algorithm, when compiled with the libsodium library.

    SFTPOptions IgnoreFIFOs, IgnoreSFTPSetExtendedAttributes, IgnoreSFTPUploadExtendedAttributes


  + API Changes

    Many of the core API have been const-ified.  This will cause build
    warnings in many existing third-party modules.


1.3.6rc2
---------

  + SSH RSA hostkeys smaller than 2048 bits now work properly.
  + MLSD response lines are now properly CRLF terminated.
  + Faster/more efficient FTP ASCII mode conversion code.
  + Support for OCSP stapling.
  + Support for the common CLNT FTP command.
  + Fixed selection of DH groups from TLSDHParamFile.

  + New Modules:

    mod_auth_otp
      The mod_auth_otp module supports one-time passwords using the HOTP and
      TOTP algorithms.  This OTP support is compatible with e.g. Google
      Authenticator and other implementations.  The mod_auth_otp module can
      thus be used to provide multi-factor authentication (MFA, 2FA) for
      both FTP and SFTP logins.  For more information, see the module
      documentation at doc/contrib/mod_auth_otp.html.

    mod_digest
      The mod_digest module implements the HASH FTP command, per the IETF
      Draft.  This module also implements previous FTP commands that achieve
      similar functionality, e.g. XCRC, XMD5, XSHA1, and others.  See the
      full module documentation at doc/contrib/mod_digest.html.

    mod_statcache
      Some sites often act as "mirrors", and/or have clients which perform
      numerous, repeated, and expensive directory listings.  These directory
      listings cause repetitive (and often redundant) lookups of the per-file
      details via the stat(2) and lstat(2) system calls.  The mod_statcache
      module caches this "stat" information, such that the cached data can
      be shared/reused across multiple FTP sessions.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_statcache.html for details.


  + New Configuration Directives:

    AllowEmptyPasswords
      By default, proftpd allows for empty passwords to be used for
      authentication.  Some sites may wish to enforce the requirement that
      passwords not be empty; this can now be accomplished via the
      AllowEmptyPasswords directive, e.g.:

        # Require non-empty passwords
        AllowEmptyPasswords on

      See doc/modules/mod_auth.html#AllowEmptyPasswords for details.
      Note that this applies to mod_sftp password-based logins as well.

    AnonAllowRobots
      Some web crawlers, notably Google, will automatically index any
      FTP sites with anonymous logins.  This behavior is now automatically
      prohibited, using auto-generated robots.txt files for <Anonymous>
      logins.  Use the new AnonAllowRobots directive to allow indexing again;
      see doc/modules/mod_auth.html#AnonAllowRobots for details.

    SQLODBCVersion
      The mod_sql_odbc module defaults to using ODBC API version 3.  However,
      some ODBC drivers may themselves expect older versions of the ODBC
      API.  This can now be configured using e.g. "SQLODBCVersion ODBCv2";
      see doc/contrib/mod_sql_odbc.html#SQLODBCVersion for more information.

    TLSSessionTickets
      The mod_tls module now supports TLS session tickets, per RFC 5077.
      See doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSSessionTicketKeys for more details.

    TLSStapling
      The mod_tls module now supports OCSP stapling by caching OCSP responses
      for server certificates, and stapling those OCSP responses in the
      SSL/TLS handshake data.  This OCSP stapling functionality is configuring
      using new directives:

        TLSStaplingCache
        TLSStaplingOptions
        TLSStaplingResponder
        TLSStaplingTimeout

      See the doc/contrib/mod_tls.html documentation for more information.


  + Changed Modules

    The mod_sftp module now supports the LINK_COUNT attribute in SFTP STAT
    requests, for clients using SFTP protocol version 6.  It also supports the
    "hardlink@openssh.com" SFTP extension.

    The mod_tls_memcache and mod_tls_shmcache modules now provide OCSP
    responder caches.


  + Changed Configuration Directives:

    BanCacheOptions
      When storing ban rules in memcached, the mod_ban module can now
      format the rules as JSON, allowing for better interoperability with
      other applications interested in those ban rules.  To use JSON,
      use "BanCacheOptions UseJSON"; see
      doc/contrib/mod_ban.html#BanCacheOptions for more information.

    BanOnEvent
      The mod_ban module can now be configured to ban clients which attempt
      to use empty passwords, when the new AllowEmptyPasswords directive is
      set to "false", via the new EmptyPassword BanOnEvent rule.  See
      doc/contrib/mod_ban.html#BanOnEvent for more information.

    LogFormat
      The mod_log module supports several new LogFormat variables.  The
      %R variable can be used for logging command response time, in
      milliseconds, which is useful for measuring response time/latency.
      Data transfer durations are separately tracked using the new
      %{transfer-millisecs} variable.  For logging the size of the file
      after data transfer (e.g. after upload), use the %{file-size} variable.
      And for logging whether the file transfer used binary or ASCII mode,
      use the %{transfer-type} variable.

    MasqueradeAddress
      Sometimes the DNS name configured for MasqueradeAddress directives
      cannot be resolved when ProFTPD starts up, such as when the network
      interface on the host machine has not yet come up.  This would cause
      ProFTPD to fail to start.

      The MasqueradeAddress directive now handles these resolution errors,
      and will attempt to resolve the DNS name later, when clients connect;
      this allows ProFTPD to start up properly in such cases.

    SFTPAuthMethods
      The mod_sftp module now supports requiring multiple authentication
      methods for a single login.  Some sites, for example, wish for clients
      to authenticate via publickey AND password.  This is supported via
      the SFTPAuthMethods directive, e.g.:

        # Require both publickey and password authentication, in any order
        SFTPAuthMethods publickey+password password+publickey

      The doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPAuthMethods documentation has more
      information.

    SFTPExtensions
      The mod_sftp module now supports the "hardlink@openssh.com" SFTP
      extension.  To disable support for this extension, use:

        SFTPExtensions -hardlink

      See doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPExtensions for details.

    SQLConnectInfo, SQLNamedConnectInfo
      The mod_sql module can now support using SSL/TLS for connections to
      backend databases, if supported by the database-specific module,
      by configuring the necessary SSL/TLS details using the SQLConnectInfo
      and SQLNamedConnectInfo directives.  See their respective documentation,
      doc/contrib/mod_sql.html#SQLConnectInfo and
      doc/contrib/mod_sql.html#SQLNamedConnectInfo for more information.

    TLSOptions
      The NoCertRequest TLSOption is now deprecated.  The mod_tls module,
      rather than requesting client certificates every time, will only do
      so if "TLSVerifyClient on" or "TLSVerifyClient optional" is configured.
      This brings the mod_tls behavior more in line with Apache behavior,
      and slightly reduces the SSL/TLS handshake latency.

    TLSProtocol
      The mod_tls module now supports excluding of particular SSL/TLS
      versions via the TLSProtocol directive, e.g.:

        # Support all TLS versions except SSLv3
        TLSProtocol ALL -SSLv3

      The doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSProtocol documentation has more
      details.

    TLSSessionCache
      When storing SSL session data in memcached, the mod_tls module can now
      format the session data using JSON, allowing for better interoperability
      with other applications interested in that session data.  To use JSON,
      use "TLSSessionCache memcache:/json".  See
      doc/contrib/mod_tls_memcache.html for more information.

    UseEncoding
      Different users/clients may wish to use different filename encodings
      for their files.  The UseEncoding directive can now be set
      per-user/group/class, by now working with mod_ifsession sections as
      expected.


1.3.6rc1
---------

  + Support the HOST command (see RFC 7151).
  + Changed the default SyslogLevel to be NOTICE, rather than DEBUG.
  + Fixed "stalled" SSL/TLS handshakes for data transfers.
  + ftpwho now supports JSON output format.
  + Fixed handling of SSH keys with overlong Comment headers in mod_sftp_sql.
  + Changed handling of logging of SFTP sessions to ExtendedLogs; see the
    notes below on the ExtendedLog directive.

  + Changed Modules

    mod_facl
      The mod_facl module now supports the MacOSX flavour of POSIX ACLs.

    mod_radius
      The mod_radius module has added support for the following RADIUS
      attributes:

        Acct-Terminate-Cause
        Event-Timestamp
        Idle-Timeout
        Message-Authenticator
        Reply-Message
        Session-Timeout

    mod_site_misc
      The SITE UTIME command now supports the 3-timestamp variant:

        SITE UTIME path atime mtime ctime

      where each timestamp is expressed as "YYYYMMDDhhmmss".

    mod_sql
      The mod_sql module would previously only support 32-bit UID/GID
      values, due to its use of the atoi(3) C library function for parsing
      result set values into IDs.  This has been fixed; mod_sql now
      properly supports 64-bit UID/GID values.

    mod_tls
      By default, mod_tls will no longer support SSLv3 connections.  In
      order to support SSLv3 connections (for sites that need to), you must
      explicitly configure this via the TLSProtocol directive, e.g.:

        TLSProtocol SSLv3 TLSv1 ...

      In addition, mod_tls will no longer support EXPORT ciphers.


  + New Configuration Directives:

    CopyEngine
      The mod_copy module is enabled by default; there may be cases where
      the module should be disabled, without requiring a rebuild of the
      server.  Thus mod_copy now supports a CopyEngine directive; see
      doc/contrib/mod_copy.html#CopyEngine.

    DelayOnEvent
      There are sites which wish to use mod_delay for administratively
      adding delays to connections as e.g. brute force attack deterrents.
      To support these use cases, the mod_delay module has a new DelayOnEvent
      directive.  Using this directive, sites can configure something like
      the following, for forcing a minimum login delay and a failed login
      delay:

        <IfModule mod_delay.c>
          # Configure successful logins to be delayed by 2 secs
          DelayOnEvent PASS 2000ms

          # Configure failed logins to be delayed by 5 secs
          DelayOnEvent FailedLogin 5s
        </IfModule>

      See doc/modules/mod_delay.html#DelayOnEvent for more information.

    ExecEnable
      Some sites using mod_exec need to configure a command to be executed,
      but wish to "blacklist" certain directories where that command should
      not be executed.  To handle configurations like this, the mod_exec
      module has a new ExecEnable directive; see
      doc/contrib/mod_exec.html#ExecEnable for details.

    FSCachePolicy
      ProFTPD has long maintained a cache of the last stat data for a file.
      However, for performance reasons, this cache size needs to be larger,
      and to be enhanced to handle expiration, etc.  To tune the size
      and expiration settings of this filesystem data cache, use the new
      FSCachePolicy directive; see doc/modules/mod_core.html#FSCachePolicy
      for details.

    LangOptions
      Currently proftpd tries to cope with various filename/character
      encodings used by FTP clients; if it cannot decode the filename, it
      will use the sent filename as-is.  This behavior can cause problems
      for downstream resources that then attempt to deal with these
      filenames, and fail.  To make proftpd be more strict about the
      encoding it accepts, use the new LangOption directive:

        LangOptions RequireValidEncoding

      See doc/modules/mod_lang.html#LangOptions.

    RadiusOptions
      The mod_radius module now supports/handles additional RADIUS
      attributes.  Some of these attribute may need to be ignore for
      some sites; others may wish to e.g. enforce stronger security by
      requiring the use of the Message-Authenticator attribute.  Thus
      mod_radius has a new RadiusOptions directive; see
      doc/contrib/mod_radius.html#RadiusOptions for details.

    ServerAlias
      Supporting true name-based virtual hosting means needing to associate
      names with the IP-based virtual hosts.  The ServerAlias directive is
      used to do this association; see doc/modules/mod_core.html#ServerAlias
      for details.

    SQLPasswordSaltEncoding
      In order to handle binary data for salts, the mod_sql_password module
      now supports handling of this data as base64- or hex-encoded data
      via the new SQLPasswordSaltEncoding directive; see
      doc/contrib/mod_sql_passwd.html#SQLPasswordSaltEncoding for details.

    TLSECDHCurve
      When an FTPS client uses an ECDHE cipher, mod_tls currently will use
      the X9.62 <code>prime256v1</code> curve.  Some sites may, however,
      wish to use other curves for ECDHE ciphers.  These sites may now use
      the new TLSECDHCurve directive to configure the curve; see
      doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSECDHCurve for details.

    TLSNextProtocol
      Newer TLS clients use the ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation)
      extension (or its earlier incarnation NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation)
      for determining the protocol that will be used over the SSL/TLS
      session.  The support for these extensions can be used by clients for
      enabling other behaviors/optimizations, such as TLS False Start.
      This directive can be used to disable mod_tls' use of the ALPN/NPN
      extensions as needed; see doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSNextProtocol
      for more details.

    TLSPreSharedKey
      Some sites may find that using pre-shared keys (PSK) is preferable
      for their TLS needs.  TLS clients in embedded or low power environments
      may find PSK to be less computationally expensive.  The mod_tls module
      now supports pre-shared keys via its TLSPreSharedKey directive; see
      doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSPreSharedKey for details.

    TransferOptions
      There are some broken (<i>e.g.</i> old/mainframe) FTP clients that
      will upload files, containing CRLF sequences, as ASCII data, but
      these clients expect these CRLF sequences to be left as-is by the
      FTP server.  To handle these broken clients, there is a new
      TransferOptions directive; see doc/modules/mod_xfer.html#TransferOptions
      for more information.


  + Changed Configuration Directives

    BanOnEvent BadProtocol
      Some clients (malicious or unintentional) may send HTTP or SMTP commands
      to ProFTPD.  ProFTPD now detects these "bad protocol" messages, and
      mod_ban can now ban clients that repeatedly do this via its BanOnEvent
      rules.  See doc/contrib/mod_ban.html#BanOnEvent for details.

    DelayTable none
      If the mod_delay module is used to enforce minimum delays, and not
      use its DelayTable for "learning" the best delay, then the DelayTable
      is not needed/used to all.  The DelayTable directive can now be used
      to tell mod_delay to not even open/lock on that table, using:

        DelayTable none

      See doc/modules/mod_delay.html#DelayTable.

    DeleteAbortedStores
      The DeleteAbortedStores directive, for Bug#3917, was meant to be
      enabled, but only when HiddenStores was in effect.  Unfortunately,
      the fix caused a regression, as DeleteAbortedStores was enabled for
      ALL transfers inadvertently.  The desired behavior, of enabling
      DeleteAbortedStores only when HiddenStores is in effect, has been
      properly implemented now.

    ExtendedLog
      When an ExtendedLog is used for logging mod_sftp requests, the log
      file will contain both the SFTP requests AND the internal FTP commands
      to which mod_sftp will map the SFTP requests; this can lead to some
      VERY verbose log files.

      For greater control over SFTP logging, the ExtendedLog directive now
      supports two new log classes: SSH, and SFTP.  In addition, it supports
      the '!' prefix, for excluding certain log classes from a given
      ExtendedLog.  For example:

        LogFormat ftp "..." ALL,EXIT,!SSH,!SFTP
        ExtendedLog /path/to/extended-ftp.log ftp

        LogFormat sftp "..." SSH,SFTP
        ExtendedLog /path/to/extended-sftp.log sftp

      NOTE that existing ExtendedLogs that expect to see the SFTP requests will
      no longer do so; adding the "SFTP" logging class to such ExtendedLogs is
      now necessary.

    HiddenStores
      Some sites may experience HiddenStores filename collisions when
      uploading FTP clients get disconnected, and/or use multiple concurrent
      sessions for uploading.  To help avoid collisions, the HiddenStores
      directive now supports the %P variable, for adding the session PID
      to the generated HiddenStore name.

      In other cases, some sites may have FTP clients that want to use the
      APPE FTP command, but cannot do so when HiddenStores is in effect.
      These FTP clients are often outside of the site's control, and not
      easily changed.  ProFTPD now automatically disables the HiddenStores
      functionality when an APPE FTP command is used; the APPE command
      can only function on an existing file anyway, and thus there is no
      loss of functionality with this policy change.

    ListOptions
      When ProFTPD generates a directory listing for FTP commands such as
      LIST or NLST, it will automatically sort the names lexicographically.
      For very wide directories, this can cause more memory/CPU usage, in
      order to sort all of these names.  This sorting can now be disabled
      via ListOptions, using:

        ListOptions -U

      See doc/modules/mod_ls.html#ListOptions for more information.

    SFTPDigests
      The mod_sftp module now supports the umac-128@openssh.com MAC
      algorithm; see doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPDigests.

    SFTPHostKey
      Large hosting sites often use a <Global> section for centralizing
      configuration of a large number of <VirtualHost> sections in their
      proftpd.conf.  Sometimes, such sites will want to disable use of
      particular SSH hostkeys for a given <VirtualHost>.  To support this
      use case, the SFTPHostKey directive can be used to ignore any
      globally-configured RSA, DSA, or ECDSA SSH hostkey, e.g.:

        SFTPHostKey NoRSA
        SFTPHostKey NoDSA

      See doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPHostKey for details.

    SFTPOptions
      Some OS distributions insist that their SSH hostkeys be group-readable.
      In order to allow mod_sftp, which has more strict SSH hostkey permission
      policies, to use those SSH hostkeys, the SFTPOptions directive can
      now be used to relax this permission policy as needed:

        SFTPOptions InsecureHostKeyPerms

      See doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPOptions for details.

      Small Diffie-Hellman groups are subject to cryptographic weaknesses;
      see https://weakdh.org.  Thus mod_sftp now avoids the use of weak
      DH groups by default; the AllowWeakDH SFTPOption is used to re-enable
      such support for clients that require it.
      See doc/contrib/mod_sftp.html#SFTPOptions.

    SNMPAgent
      Some sites may wish to have mod_snmp listening on multiple
      addresses (e.g. on multi-homed servers), including IPv6 addresses.
      The SNMPAgent directive now supports this, e.g.:

        <IfModule mod_snmp.c>
          SNMPAgent master 127.0.0.1:1161 10.0.1.2:1161 [::]
        </IfModule>

      See doc/contrib/mod_snmp.html#SNMPAgent for more information.

    TLSOptions
      Small Diffie-Hellman groups are subject to cryptographic weaknesses;
      see https://weakdh.org.  Thus mod_tls now avoids the use of weak
      DH groups by default; the AllowWeakDH TLSOption is used to re-enable
      such support for clients that require it.
      See doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSOptions.


  + Changed Command Handling

    When handling the STAT FTP command, ProFTPD now follows RFC 959 more
    closely, and will use the 213 response code for STAT commands on files,
    and the 212 response code for STAT commands on directories.  Previously,
    ProFTPD would respond to all STAT commands using the 211 response code.


  + Changed Utilities

    The ftpwho command-line utility can now emit its data as JSON,
    for easier parsing/reuse in other utilities.  To request JSON, use:

      $ ftpwho -o json
