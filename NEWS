  commands.
- Bug 3229 - LangDefault does not accept any setting on FreeBSD.
- Bug 2368 - Allow contrib modules to extend mod_sql's SQLAuthTypes.  This

--------------------------------
- Bug 1801 - Faulty SQLConnectInfo PERCALL policy - connections not closed
  after each call.

- Bug 3133 - mod_facts should advertise TVFS support in the FEAT response.
- Bug 3128 - mod_sql_sqlite should use transactions for INSERT/UPDATE
  statements.
- Bug 3155 - Change the IdentLookups default to 'off'.  The RFC1413 IDENT
  lookup adds latency to the login process, so much so that it is a FAQ
  to configure "IdentLookups off".  In addition, the IDENT protocol is not
  secure; it can easily be spoofed using man-in-the-middle attacks.  Sites
  that require IDENT lookups must now explicitly configure "IdentLookups on".
- Bug 3156 - Allow resumed downloads when HiddenStore is in effect.
- Bug 3170 - RewriteMap unescape URL encoding broken by RewriteCondition
  backreference handling.

  to use for the host, rather than using DNS to resolve the host IP address
  from the hostname.

  size.
- Added mod_sftp, mod_sftp_pam, and mod_sftp_sql to the contrib modules.

  BanEngine directive can now appear in an <IfClass> section, in order
  to exclude connection classes from mod_ban's rules.

- Bug 3154 - Update bundled libtool version.  The bundled libltdl version
  has been updated to libtool 1.5.26.

- Bug 3189 - Linker errors occur when using "make -j" parallel builds.
  ProFTPD now builds successfully using "make -jN", where N is the number
  of simultaneous build processes to use.
- Bug 3176 - Postgres chokes on standard charset names.

  tool now handles the $Libraries$ build system hints in source files,
  and honors the DESTDIR environment variable.
- Bug 3167 - Support rewriting of home directories.
- Bug 2985 - Newest .spec file requires relatively current version of RPM.
  The provided .spec file now requires RPM 4.2 or later.
- Bug 3207 - Support for SSL/TLS session caching across processes/machines.
  The mod_tls module now supports a TLSSessionCache directive, and an API
  for modules to provide external SSL session caching mechanisms.
- Bug 3210 - Data transfers protected by SSL/TLS should reuse the control
  connection SSL session.  If the TLSRequired policy allows/requires SSL/TLS
  protections on data transfers, then reuse of the SSL session from the
  control connection is now enforced.  Use "TLSOptions NoSessionReuseRequired"
  to relax this requirement.
- Bug 3215 - mod_wrap2_sql should support comma-delimited lists of clients.
  This is the same as Bug#3048, only it affects the mod_wrap2_sql module.

  SQLAuthenticate parameter.  See the SQLUserInfo description for more details.
- Bug 3226 - HideFiles directive not working properly in <Anonymous> sections.
- Bug 3231 - Use getgrset(3) on AIX to emulate getgrouplist(3).
- Bug 3043 - SQLGroupInfo should allow custom queries.  See the SQLGroupInfo
  description for more information.
- Bug 2178 - Extend TLSRequired for <Directory> and .ftpaccess contexts.
- Bug 3209 - mod_wrap2 should support the 'spawn' feature (or equivalent) of
  tcpwrappers.  Using mod_wrap/mod_wrap2 in conjunction with the mod_exec
  module, this is now possible.
- Bug 3225 - Opening of files during restart can inappropriately use
  stdin/stdout/stderr descriptors, leading to bad behavior.  The "bad behavior"
  can manifest as server shutdown (due to mod_tls errors),
  "Bad file descriptor" log messages, etc.
- Bug 3234 - SSL connections can cause 100% CPU usage.
- Bug 3233 - Dynamic config causes many copies of static configs to be merged.

- Bug 3247 - "TLSRequired auth" and "TLSOptions AllowPerUser" are incompatible.
- Bug 3256 - "SO_OOBINLINE" error occuring again.  This is a regression of
  Bug 2332 caused by code movement in 1.3.2.
- Bug 3258 - Log cluttered with "using sendfile capability" messages.
- Bug 3261 - Badly formatted TLSRenegotiate directive causes proftpd to hang.
- Bug 3257 - CAP_AUDIT_WRITE capability needed for some PAM modules.
- Bug 3243 - Broken support for AllowOverride per user/group/class conditionals.
  The user/group/class conditional arguments to the AllowOverride directive
  were not properly honored.  The fix for this is to remove all support in
  the AllowOverride directive, and instead use mod_ifsession for conditionals.

- Added Chinese translation
- Bug 3076 - RPM build failing on 64 bit OS due to incomplete .spec.
- Bug 3082 - Use "DEFAULT" keyword instead of "ALL" for Trace directive.
  Hopefully the "DEFAULT" keyword will be more accurate, more descriptive

  SSL/TLS protocol information to the TLSLog.
- Bug 2969 - Allow APPE after REST.
- Bug 2983 - Use getgrouplist(3) for group lookup, if available.  This may
  potentially speed up the group membership lookup on some systems.
- Bug 2984 - mod_auth_file uid2name() does not cache results causing slow LIST
  response.

  speed up data transfers, especially rapid-fire data transfers as used by
  "download accelerators".
- Bug 2979 - Ability to ban clients which connect too often.  The mod_ban
  module now supports a "ClientConnectRate" BanOnEvent rule.

  SITE CHMOD.
- Bug #2995 - The %f LogFormat variable expanded to same file for RNFR and
  RNTO.
- Bug #2996 - Requirement for same OpenSSL header, library version in mod_tls
  too restrictive.  If differences are detected now, the difference is logged,
  but the daemon will start up.
- Bug 3005 - OOB abort closes the control connection.
- Bug 3004 - 'ScanOnLogin' QuotaOption does not honor QuotaDirectoryTally
  directive.

  "AuthPAMOptions NoTTY" to disable this.
- Bug 2741 - Apply TimeoutNoTransfer, TimeoutStalled, TimeoutIdle to
  <Anonymous> section.
- Bug 2997 - Uploading files with "~" causes harmless but annoying log
  message.
- Bug 2889 - Update SQLLog so that RNTO stores the path when using the
  %F variable.

  scheduling priority of the session process during file transfers.
- Bug 3020 - Server replies to NLST with 450 at the wrong time.
- Bug 1771 - mod_ratio compile warnings.
- Bug 1973 - mod_ratio uses the too-small int datatype for tracking bytes.
  The mod_ratio module has been updated to use off_t, instead of int, for
  tracking bytes.

  and passwdexpired() functions, if present, are now used by the mod_auth_unix
  module during login.
- Bug 2453 - Separate RFC1413 code into mod_ident module.
- Bug 3023 - Allow uploading to /dev/null.  This allows testing of network
  link speeds by uploading directly to /dev/null on the server.
- Bug 3022 - Timed SQL connections don't reconnect to database.
- Added mod_sql_sqlite contrib module, for authenticating using a SQLite
  database.  See doc/contrib/mod_sql_sqlite.html for more details.

  glob ACLs.
- Bug 3033 - Class rules not honoring '!' negation character.
- Bug 3034 - Rewritten command parameters need to be set in multiple places.
- Bug 2577 - IPv6 support should be enabled by default.  IPv6 support is
  now enabled by default in the proftpd build, but the shipping
  proftpd.conf has:

    UseIPv6 off

  To disable IPv6 support completely at build time, use the --disable-ipv6
  configure option.
- Bug 2000 - mod_cap should not use bundled libcap.  Now if a system libcap
  is present, that system library will be used instead of the bundled libcap.
  If no system libcap is present, the bundled libcap will be used.
- Bug 3044 - Segfault if mod_delay fails to load DelayTable.
- Bug 3048 - mod_wrap2_file should support comma-delimited lists of clients.
- Bug 3045 - "QuotaOptions ScanOnLogin" does not work for 'class' or
  'all' limits.
- Bug 3047 - BanOnEvent should support optional ban message.  Now messages
  for individual ban rules can be configured, in addition to the BanMessage
  directive.
- Added contrib/ftpmail, a Perl script which reads a TransferLog FIFO and
  sends automatic email notifications whenever uploads occur.  See
  doc/contrib/ftpmail.html for more details.
- Bug 3050 - Support use of OpenSSL in FIPS mode.  See doc/howto/TLS.html for
  details on how to use FIPS mode.
- Bug 3051 - mod_quotatab incorrectly reduces file count on rename.
- Bug 2840 - Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) support.
- Bug 3058 - Handling of OPTS command results in badly set values in code.
- Bug 3059 - Wrong handling of UTF8 conversions.
- Bug 3061 - Segfault in mod_quotatab_sql if the SQL query returns NULL
  bytes/files values.
- Bug 3056 - Support non-UTF8 encoding and character sets.  See
  doc/modules/mod_lang.html for more information on the UseEncoding directive.
- Bug 3064 - Better handling of 0xFF character for Cyrillic, non-UTF8 charsets.
  These character sets use the same value as the Telnet IAC character in
  the alphabet.  RFC959 states that FTP control messages must support Telnet
  characters; this requirement causes problems for the character sets.
  This the RFC959 requirement is relaxed if --enable-nls is used, and if
  one of the problematic character sets is configured.

1.3.1 - Released 5-Oct-2007
--------------------------------
- Bug 2944 - mod_sql_mysql fails to compile due to missing quotation.

- Bug 2963 - Use of -A option for LIST/NLST commands not cleared for
  subsequent commands.
- Bug 2964 - Building RPM fails because of *snprintf trying to be redefined.
  This is actually caused by a particular combination of compiler flags
  (-O2 and -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2), which are used by the `rpmbuild'
  command in some Linux releases.
- Bug 2974 - Install error if multiple modules, using their own build script,
  are built as shared modules.
- Bug 2981 - Command-line long options --ipv4 and --ipv6 do not work.

- Bug 2893 - ProFTPD can use the wrong group data if the user name changes.
- Bug 2897 - mod_quotatab subtracts size of deleted file from bytes-transferred
  tally.

  explicit compiler cast to ensure that the proper data type size is used
  in the arguments for a variadic function.
- Bug 2906 - RewriteCondition backreferences not properly substituted.
- Bug 2913 - TYPE command does not clear ASCII flag from LIST/NLST commands.
- Bug 2911 - NLST on a nonexistent path, followed by an NLST on an existing
  file, causes segfault.
- Bug 2922 - Auth API allows one auth module to authenticate user data provided
  by a different auth module.
- Bug 2921 - NLST fails if using POSIX ACLs.  The mod_ls module, when
  handling the NLST command, was using an unnecessary access(2) check.
- Bug 2864 - DisplayLogin should work regardless of chroot.  This now works
  for DisplayQuit and DisplayTransferFiles as well.
- Bug 2920 - ABOR command not handled during data transfer.
- Bug 2924 - DeleteAbortedStores doesn't work when the ABOR command is used.
- Bug 2890 - SystemLog permission errors on SIGHUP when mod_tls is enabled.
- Bug 2932 - Syslog contains "error setting IPV6_V6ONLY: Protocol not
  available".  Check the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option first, and only attempt
  to disable it if needed.  Also use the IPPROTO_IPV6 socket level.
- Bug 2934 - Function perm_copy_fd() not in older Linux libacl versions.
- Bug 2923 - ftptop display flickers if delay is greater than 25 seconds.

1.3.1rc1 - Released 12-Dec-2006
--------------------------------
- Bug 2766 - Support for automatic stack trace if SIGSEGV is received.
- Bug 2714 - mod_auth_file munges AuthUserFile, AuthGroupFile records.
- Bug 2721 - mod_auth_unix does not behave properly when first in AuthOrder.
- Bug 2535 - Compare directives using integer comparisons when possible to
  improve performance.
- Bug 2753 - CCC not closing SSL/TLS connection correctly.
- Bug 2654 - FEAT command should be subject to <Limit>.
- Bug 2740 - TYPE command not allowed before USER/PASS, causes problem for
  `ftp -n'.
- Bug 2777 - ProFTPD does handle data sockets properly on FreeBSD 6.
- Bug 2664 - Add 'delay info' ftpdctl action for showing DelayTable values.
  This patch also added a 'delay reset' ftpdctl action, for clearing the
  DelayTable.
- Bug 2769 - mod_auth_pam needs a patch to allow pam_group to work.
- Bug 2599 - Support for using OpenSSL "engines".
- Bug 2611 - CreateHome should allow non-root-owned parent directories.
- Bug 2686 - Allow CCC command but still require SSL/TLS protection during
  authentication.
- Bug 2628 - SQLHomedirOnDemand should be deprecated.  The CreateHome
  directive should be used instead.
- Bug 2627 - Support for RADIUS quotatab module.  The mod_quotatab_radius
  module has been added to the contrib/ directory.  See README.modules
  and doc/contrib/mod_quotatab_radius.html for more information.
- Bug 2651 - LogFormat should support variable for logging the response
  message.  A new %S logging variable has been added.
- Bug 2447 - HAVE_OPENSSL should be managed by configure.  There is a
  new configure option, --enable-openssl, which is honored by mod_ldap
  and mod_sql.  This configure option can be used instead of using
  the HAVE_OPENSSL CFLAGS variable, although HAVE_OPENSSL will still work.
- Bug 2733 - IP TOS not being set for data transfers.  Other socket-level
  options were not being properly honored for data transfers, too.
- Added mod_ban.  See doc/contrib/mod_ban.html for more details.
- Enhanced the mod_sql API to allow other modules (such as mod_conf_sql)
  to make fuller use of SQL databases via mod_sql.
- Bug 2713 - Ability to check a user's existing disk bytes/files usage and
  update tally accordingly.  The mod_quotatab module now has a QuotaOptions
  directive, one of whose parameters is ScanOnLogin, which directs the
  module to update existing tallies after scanning the user's home
  directory.
- Bug 2786 - REST in ASCII mode returns error but leaves session in
  inconsistent state.
- Bug 2785 - IPv4-mapped IPv6 network ACLs not matched properly against
  IPv4 connections.
- Bug 2732 - Support for DisplayChdir, rather than DisplayFirstChdir.
- Bug 2506 - Better ability to configure what sort of debug output to generate.
  This is done via the new Trace and TraceLog directives.
- Bug 2514 - Trouble with mod_tls and DSA certificates.
- Bug 2792 - ProFTPD fails after SIGHUP signal when Controls support is
  enabled.
- Bug 2775 - Support for DisplayFileTransfer directive.
- Bug 2793 - LogFormat variable for the ProFTPD version.  This adds a
  "%{version}" variable to the LogFormat directive.
- Bug 2797 - Add ability to force cleaning the scoreboard.  This can now
  be done using "ftpdctl scoreboard scrub".
- Bug 2800 - free_proc_title() in developer build tries to free strings from
  pool allocated by mod_tls.
- Bug 2801 - Error compiling proftpd on NetBSD 3.0/sparc64.
- Bug 2687 - Support for more efficient group table schema.  A new
  directive, SQLOptions, has been added.  One possible parameter of this
  directive is 'useNormalizedGroupSchema', in which case mod_sql will
  process the group info table in a more efficient manner.
- Bug 2798 - MDTM should return time in GMT.  MDTM responses now always use GMT.
- Bug 2784 - Ability to specify MySQL Unix domain socket path.
- Bug 2610 - Support for logging to /var/log/lastlog.  See the RELEASE_NOTES
  for more details on how to use this feature.
- Bug 2710 - ProFTPD should install its header files into the installation
  location.  The `make install' target now causes proftpd header files,
  including config.h, to be installed into a include/proftpd/ directory
  in the installation location.
- Bug 2626 - ERROR macro collision can cause compiler errors on HP-UX.
  The ERROR, DECLINED, and HANDLED macros have been renamed PR_ERROR,
  PR_DECLINED, and PR_HANDLED, respectively.  Compatibility macros for
  older contrib modules are available.
- Bug 2807 - mod_sql processes SQLLog QUIT query twice.  This bug is a
  consequence of Bug 1965.
- Bug 2810 - Incorrect use of assignment instead of comparison in mod_wrap.
- Bug 2803 - mod_auth_file does not properly iterate through AuthUserFile
  entries.
- Bug 2809 - conf.h should be included before mysql.h in mod_sql_mysql.c.
- Bug 2774 - Idle clients exhibit excessive usage of system resources.
  This occurs because of interrupted system calls, which trigger tightly
  spinning retry loops within the process.  The ability to tune the delay
  used in these retry loops has been added to address this behavior.
- Added mod_wrap2, mod_wrap2_file, and mod_wrap2_sql.  See
  doc/contrib/mod_wrap2.html for more details.
- Bug 2825 - SSL/TLS CRLs are not working properly.
- Bug 2835 - Group quotas not honored for supplemental group membership.
- Bug 2837 - Defines improperly persist across daemon restarts.
- Bug 2839 - ProFTPD seems to re-read the file two times in RETR command.
  The problem was one where sendfile() was being used, and the sendfile()
  called failed for some reason.  In that case, proftpd would fall back
  to transmitting the data via normal, non-sendfile() means.  If the
  sendfile() call had actually sent data to the client already, this
  fallback attempt would result in the client receiving too much data.
  Now, if there was an error using sendfile(), proftpd logs the error
  and considers it a failed transfer due to an I/O error.
- Bug 2756 - Support for TLSPassPhraseProvider.
- Bug 2799 - SQLNamedQuery should support environment variables.  SQL
  queries defined using the SQLNamedQuery directive can now use
  "%{env:VAR}" to have the environment variable VAR substituted into the
  query.
- Bug 2828 - Support variables in SQL Where directives.  Now the variables
  supported for SQLNamedQuery statements, except for "%{n}" numeric
  references, are also supported for the SQLGroupWhereClause and
  SQLUserWhereClause directives.
- Bug 2842 - Filesystem statcache is not correctly caching return value of
  stat().
- Bug 2817 - Ability to disable IPv6 support at runtime.  You can now
  configure "UseIPv6 off" in your proftpd.conf to disable IPv6 support
  (assuming proftpd was compiled using --enable-ipv6).
- Bug 2847 - HiddenStores files not properly removed if data transfer times
  out.
- Bug 2848 - Unable to properly parse config files using Windows-style line
  endings.  Such line endings can appear in the proftpd.conf if the file
  is transferred using Windows machines, or using FTP clients that do not
  properly translate CRLF to LF when handling ASCII files.
- Bug 2850 - Small event pool allocation on 64-bit machine leads to segfault
  on startup.
- Bug 2860 - Failure to check for data length in mod_tls could lead to remote
  buffer overwriting.
- Bug 2863 - LIST of nonexistent file causes RST on data channel.
- Bug 2862 - NLST / returns a listing of the current directory.
- Bug 2867 - Local authorized user buffer overflow in Controls request
  handling.

1.3.0a - Released 27-Nov-2006
--------------------------------
- Bug 2858 - CVE-2006-5815: remote code execution in ProFTPD.

1.3.0 - Released 16-Apr-2006
--------------------------------
- Bug 2733 - libtool requires sh/bash.
- Bug 2770 - FreeBSD compiler warning that "__GLIBC__" is not defined.
- Bug 2771 - FreeBSD compiler warning about undeclared fgetpwent/fgetgrent
  functions.
- Bug 2772 - FreeBSD compiler warning that "_FILE_OFFSET_BITS" is not defined.

1.3.0rc5 - Released 18-Mar-2006
--------------------------------
- Bug 2757 - Add support for quota modules to RPM spec.
- Bug 2759 - Adding --with-includes to configure can cause problems when
  building with other packages.  Fixed so that CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS are
  restored to their original settings after running the configure
  script.  This was a regression (of sorts) from fixing Bug #2708.
- Bug 2764 - REST command does not return an error for negative numbers.
- Bug 2717 - Wrong timestamp in logs for chrooted processes.  Ultimately
  this behavior looks to be a glibc bug.  In the meantime, the workaround
  is to manually set the TZ environment variable, if it is not already
  set, before calling chroot().  This bug appears to be specific to
  glibc, thus the workaround is only enabled on platforms using glibc-2.3
  or later.
- Bug 2765 - Child process segfaults while handling a SIGTERM.
- Bug 2723 - mod_delay causes process to hang on OS X when proftpd exits.

1.3.0rc4 - Released 01-Mar-2006
--------------------------------
- Bug 2703 - Disk quota exceeded for small files not being triggered.
- Bug 2706 - utmp/wtmp logging on NetBSD needs some tweaks.
- Bug 2708 - configure cannot detect some headers.  The configure
  script now adds the directories mentioned via the --with-includes
  and --with-libraries options to the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment
  variables.
- Bug 2711 - Controls socket detection broken.
- Bug 2712 - DisplayFirstChdir directive does not work.
- Bug 2705 - proftpd fails to log anything to syslog after dropping privs
  on Solaris.  This happens because of the default permissions on /dev/log
  on Solaris.
- Portability tweaks for Mac OS 10.4.
- Bug 2729 - Authorative PAM authentication doesn't work.  The mod_auth_pam
  module still had code for supporting the deprecated AuthPAMAuthoritative
  directive.  As per Bug #2440, however, the AuthOrder directive should
  be used for configuring authoritativeness.  This fixes mod_auth_pam
  to behave properly using the new AuthOrder setting.
- Bug 2709 - mod_sql improperly strips spaces from names, allowing for
  confusing authentication.
- Bug 2735 - Allow REST 0 in ASCII mode.
- Bug 2746 - Data transfer function does not return error condition in case of
  read errors.
- Bug 2752 - FEAT reply not RFC 2389 compliant.

1.3.0rc3 - Released 31-Oct-2005
--------------------------------
- Bug 2660 - Add mod_facl in rpm spec file.
- Bug 2662 - OpenSolaris/Solaris 11 has TCP_CORK but not SOL_TCP.
- Bug 2667 - mod_tls handles SIGHUP badly.
- Bug 2668 - mod_ctrls fails to open socket during SIGHUP.
- Bug 2669 - mod_radius segfaults if PASS command sent with no USER command.
- Bug 2674 - mod_sql string escape problem during group lookups.
- Bug 2676 - configure option --disable-ipv6 enables IPv6.
- Bug 2685 - ListOptions' max parameters cannot be set higher than 255.
- Bug 2689 - Parser does not complain about unclosed configuration sections.
- Bug 2695 - Client IP/host is not logged when client exits.
- Bug 2697 - Improper SSL session shutdown sequence used for some FTPS clients.
- Bug 2682 - Signals can interrupt privilege switching.
- Bug 2692 - R_DUP response messages can break the FTP protocol responses.

1.3.0rc2 - Released 24-Jul-2005
--------------------------------
- Bug 2584 - mod_sql_postgres missing end-of-comment character.
- Bug 2587 - HideNoAccess does not work for DefaultRoot/<Anonymous> logins.
- Bug 2590 - AIX uses unsigned int for ULONG_MAX, causing printf format warning.
- Bug 2591 - wrong argument type in call to pr_log_debug in mod_delay.c on AIX.
- Bug 2593 - `make install-modules' does not honour DESTDIR enviroment variable.
- Bug 2596 - STAT command can cause segfault.
- Bug 2588 - AIX requires _USE_IRS #define to use hstrerror().
- Bug 2582 - ProFTPD on Tru64 with SIA does not call sia_ses_estab().
- Added new 'dns' control to mod_ctrls_admin, for enabling/disabling
  UseReverseDNS configuration at runtime.  See doc/contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html
  for details.
- Bug 2605 - Compiler warnings/errors about missing typecasts on HP-UX.
- Bug 2589 - Makefile in modules/ directory is not portable.
- Bug 2598 - Build system should check for duplicate module requests.
- Bug 2585 - Proftpd does not write RFC 3164 compliant messages into /dev/log.
- Bug 2601 - mod_delay sometimes delays for a long time.
- Bug 2622 - Segfault seen randomly in mod_delay.
- Bug 2578 - ProFTPD does not listen on IPv6 addresses on FreeBSD.
- Bug 2624 - "fh_data" macro collision causes compiler error on Tru64 V5.1A.
- Bug 2250 - Add ports, compiling info to FreeBSD README.
- Bug 2631 - Segfault when using RadiusAcctServer.
- Bug 2632 - Invalid application of `sizeof' to an incomplete type on AIX.
- Bug 2637 - <Limit STAT> does not work.
- Bug 2636 - Data connection failure when handling STOR does not trigger
  error response.
- Bug 2639 - HiddenStores does not work.
- Bug 2630 - Use of mmap in mod_delay may be problematic on HP-UX.  This
  change adds locking of the DelayTable, which may (or may not) also
  help on other platforms.
- Bug 2644 - mod_sql_mysql should handle old MySQL password format more
  gracefully.  Starting with MySQL 4.1.1, the format for passwords stored
  using the MySQL PASSWORD() function changed.  This format change causes
  issues for sites that have passwords stored in the older format.  Users
  of mod_sql+mod_sql_mysql would see this as users being unable to login.
  Now, if compiled against MySQL 4.1.1 or later, mod_sql_mysql will first
  check the password using the current MySQL format; if that fails it
  will fall back to checking the old format.  Note that this only affects
  sites which have "SQLAuthTypes Backend" in their proftpd.conf.
- Bug 2647 - Improper "socklen_t" redefine for HP-UX when using X/Open.
- Fixed mod_sql bug where using SQLLog and SQLNamedQuery with the %L or
  %a variables, and logging the EXIT pseudo-command, would cause a segfault.
- Bug 2375 - Slow directory listing with several blank .ftpaccess files.
- Bug 2646 - ftpshut format string vulnerability.
- Bug 2645 - SQLShowInfo format string vulnerability.
- Bug 2560 - Reporting errors when user filesystem quota is exceeded.
- Bug 2653 - When MaxStoreFileSize is reached, error should be EDQUOT rather
  than EPERM.
- Bug 2657 - Segfault in tls_get_error() function in mod_tls.
- Bug 2658 - Segfault in mod_radius when using long password.

1.3.0rc1 - Released 10-Apr-2005
--------------------------------
- Bug 2449 - ProFTPD silently ignores extra command-line parameters
- Bug 2457 - Directory listing provides bad info when path ends with /.
- Bug 2458 - Bad handling of CreateHome parameters.
- Bug 2463 - mod_xfer doesn't check how many bytes it has written to disk.
- Bug 2476 - Incorrect detection of symbolic link loop across devices.
- Add support for a -V command-line option, which displays various
  compile-time settings.
- Bug 2455 - Allow fine-tuning of how often mod_xfer updates the scoreboard.
  This adds an --enable-scoreboard-updates configure option.
- Bug 2389 - 64-bit compilation warnings.
- Bug 2468 - Ability to disable address/port collision checking.  A new
  command-line option, -N, can be used to disable proftpd's checks for
  <VirtualHost> address/port collisions.
- Bug 2488 - Wrong order of privs calls on HP generates "unable to setregid()"
  error (Bug #2317 revisited).
- Bug 2392 - mod_sql needs better handling of its backend modules.
- Daniel Weuthen <dw@megabit.net> contributed a SuSE-specific init.d script
  for ProFTPD.
- Bug 2485 - SQL backend modules close all open connections too early.
  This fixes a bug where a "signal 11" would be reported, when a session
  ends, if the "EXIT" SQLLog command was configured.
- New mod_ldap version 2.8.13
- Bug 2490 - <Limit ALL> affects PORT command.  When the EPRT, EPSV, PASV,
  and PORT commands became <Limit>able (see Bug #2086), they became
  affected by <Limit ALL> as well, which breaks older configurations.
  Using the following configuration:

    <Limit PORT PASV>
      AllowAll
    </Limit>

  is a way to workaround this bug in 1.2.10 installations.
- Bug 2492 - Off-by-one error in FreeBSD PAM username length check.
- Bug 2496 - NLST off-by-one bug when handling relative paths in a chrooted
  session.
- Bug 2494 - ABOR problem with Cisco routers copy ftp flash.
- Bug 2499 - make_cmd() does not NULL-terminate cmd->argv[].
- Bug 2497 - Users can login without password if pam_start() fails.
- Bug 2273 - Ability to limit number of unauthenticated clients from a single
  host.  There is a new MaxConnectionsPerHost directive for configuring
  the maximum number of connections from a single host at the same time.
- Bug 1965 - Change timing of handling of QUIT command.  The actual ending
  of the session is now done by LOG_CMD/LOG_CMD_ERR handlers for the QUIT
  command.  This allows modules that wish to do POST_CMD processing of
  QUIT, like mod_sql, a chance to see the command.
- Bug 2484 - Better ftptop formatting.
- Bug 2071 - Add Variables API.
- Added DSO support.  See the README.DSO file for more information.
- Bug 2509 - sendfile() usage fails with > 2GB files.
- Bug 2480 - Remote users discovery. Leon Juranic described an information
  leak via timing differences in the handling of the USER command for
  valid versus invalid users.  The mod_delay module was added to address
  this timing difference.  See doc/modules/mod_delay.html for details.
- Bug 2518 - Ability to log SSL/TLS commands in an ExtendedLog.  A
  new "SEC" logging class has been added for use in ExtendedLog directives,
  e.g 'ExtendedLog /path/to/rfc2228.log SEC'.
- Bug 2507 - Enable use of sendfile by default.  Use the new UseSendfile
  directive to disable, e.g. 'UseSendfile off'.
- Bug 2471 - Restart command (REST) is not working correctly for text files.
  When in ASCII mode, ProFTPD now refuses to handle REST.  This behavior
  is documented in doc/howto/ASCII.html.
- Bug 2454 - Extend <VirtualHost> to honor multiple addresses.  With this
  change, the Bind directive is now deprecated.  See the RELEASE_NOTES
  for more details.
- Bug 2516 - Getting "421 Login Timeout" immediately upon connect.
- Bug 2520 - Turning on AuthAliasOnly disables MaxClientsPerHost.
- Bug 2510 - Use of ExportCertData TLSOption leads to segfault.
- Bug 2528 - Incorrect username 'and' parsing in AllowUser.
- Bug 2170 - Add byte count variables, similar to the file count Display
  variables.  The added variable names are:

     %{total_bytes_in}
     %{total_bytes_out}
     %{total_bytes_xfer}

  In addition, variables of a similar syntax can be used for display
  file counts, instead of the already-existing variables:

     %{total_files_in}
     %{total_files_out}
     %{total_files_xfer}

- Bug 2027 - Add log message for timed out passive transfers.
- Bug 2406 - Add a SQLEngine directive.  See the mod_sql documentation
  for details.
- Bug 2229 - NLST and LIST behave differently e.g. when listing an empty
  directory.
- Bug 2534 - Add suport for -S ListOption, for sorting files by file size.
- Bug 2536 - mod_ifsession does not properly merge in all directives.
- Bug 2540 - Fails to disable mod_delay if no DelayTable file exists.
- Bug 2541 - <Directory ~user> path resolved at startup time, rather than at
  session time.
- Bug 2549 - Allow contrib modules to be built from multiple source files.
- Bug 1651 - Add contrib module to limit connection acceptance based on system
  load.  mod_load is now one of the provided contrib/ modules.
- Bug 2503 - Bundled libcap library does not compile on IA64 machine.
- Bug 2556 - Rename of directory across devices fails.  The solution is to
  prevent renaming of directories.  Proper support for copying of directories
  will require module support.
- Bug 2563 - Linking fails on Solaris with libz and libmysqlclient.  The
  linker in question was Solaris ld, not GNU ld; the Solaris linker is
  more particular about the order of specified libraries.  GNU ld is
  less strict.
- Bug 2331 - ProFTPD should honor POSIX ACLs.  Please read the README.facl
  file for more information on POSIX ACL support in ProFTPD.
- Bug 2573 - TLSProtocol directive in proftpd.conf is ignored.  By fixing
  this bug, sites may find that a mod_tls configuration which worked
  prior to 1.3.0rc1 now does not work, failing with an error like
  "wrong version number" appearing in the TLSLog.  To restore the previous
  behavior, these sites can use "TLSProtocol SSLv23" in proftpd.conf.
- Bug 2559 - IPv6 socket option should be set for ServerType inetd.
- Bug 2164 - Support non-PASS response codes (i.e. 232).
- Bug 2515 - mod_quotatab should enforce hard limits at the filesystem level.
- Bug 2567 - Segmentation fault with 64-bit binary due to structure layout
  difference.
- Bug 2551 - Recursive LIST with symlinked directories gives duplicate results.
- Bug 2576 - PWD command does not handle " character properly.
- Bug 2493 - mod_tls should support CCC command.
- Bug 2580 - ProFTPD on Tru64 with SIA allows login with blank password.
- Bug 2554 - mod_delay gets segfault-signal on several logins.

1.2.10 - Released 04-Sep-2004
--------------------------------
- Bug 2440 - Unable to use PAM authentication properly.  Use a "*" after
  the module name in an AuthOrder directive to indicate that an auth
  module is authoritative.
- Bug 2441 - AIX5 portability bug with mod_auth_unix, mod_auth_file.
- Bug 2442 - Segfault in FreeBSD PAM library with long login names.
- Bug 2445 - AuthUserFile in <Global> context overrides <VirtualHost> setting.
- Bug 2444 - Use of sendfile() does not interoperate well with RFC2228
  security mechanisms.  Using sendfile(2) to send data bypasses the handling
  of the data by RFC2228 security mechanisms (such as those provided by
  mod_tls).  So if security mechanisms are detected, do not use sendfile().
- Scrub the ScoreboardFile for stale sessions in inetd mode.
- Bug 2427 - proftpd gets a memory fault when run from ssh batch mode.

1.2.10rc3 - Released 13-Jul-2004
--------------------------------
- Fixed typo that prevented 1.2.10rc2 from compiling.

1.2.10rc2 - Released 13-Jul-2004
---------------------------------
- Bug 2396 - NLST command doesn't understand options.  This was caused by
  the solution for Bug 2322.  However, it is not a popular solution, so
  NLST will once again handle options, but only the relevant options.
- Bug 2034 - Add support for a "graceful shutdown" signal. See
  contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html#shutdown for details.
- Bug 2400 - <Class> search order is wrong.  The documentation correctly
  stated that <Class> sections are matched in order of definition, but the
  code has the match order in the reverse order of definition.
- Bug 2401 - MaxClientsPerClass only checks first directive in config file.
- Bug 2399 - Rename start/stop control actions to up/down.
- Bug 2082 - Add mod_rewrite "replaceall" builtin function.  See the
  RewriteMap documentation for more details.
- Bug 2403 - Sending SIGHUP to proftpd stops it when using Classes.  The fix
  for Bug #2400 could result in an infinite loop during a SIGHUP.
- Bug 2405 - "LIST *" should not list dotfiles.
- Bug 2366 - Add support for -h LIST option.
- Bug 2332 - SO_OOBINLINE error after upgrading proftpd from 1.2.6 to 1.2.9.
  This is due mostly to a change in the logging; a check for error values
  and logging of them was added.  The setting of this particular socket option
  has been moved earlier in the session, as it was found that short-lived
  TCP connections, as from monitoring systems, would cause this error.
- Bug 2407 - mod_auth_file does not allow for proper cascading of "end" and
  "set" auth requests.
- Bug 2410 - CreateHome always copies skel directory.
- Bug 2336 - Use of /dev/log on Solaris leads to kernel memory leak.
  ProFTPD's use of the /dev/log device on Solaris was tickling a Solaris
  kernel bug that caused the Solaris kernel to leak memory.
- Added a TimeoutLinger directive to complement the --enable-timeout-linger
  configure option.
- Bug 2125 - -vv command line switch should list versions of modules.
- Bug 2420 - Name field is not escaped before querying database.
  The mod_quotatab module was not properly escaping the name string it
  used when looking up records from SQL databases.
- Bug 2424 - SQLDefaultHomedir overrides column value.
- Bug 2411 - Caching effects cause RNTO to fail if AllowOverwrite is off and
  target path does not exist.
- Bug 2422 - %v not working in SQLNamedQuery.
- Bug 2418 - chmod returns 550 with filename containing multiple spaces.
- Bug 2431 - mod_sql does not use UID/GID properly in cache lookups.
- Bug 2303 - Problem evaluating multiple <Class> rules.
- Bug 2419 - Ability to disable TLSRequired on per-user basis (e.g. for
  anonymous logins).
- Bug 2438 - Display variable %z not expanded properly.
- Bug 2439 - <Limit CWD> doesn't work.

1.2.10rc1 - Released 28-Apr-2004
---------------------------------
- Bug 2135 - Add ability to handle passphrase-protected server keys.  mod_tls
  can now properly prompt for passphrases for protected server certificate
  keys when the daemon is starting up.
- Bug 2086 - Add limits for PORT, PASV.  This means that now one can use
  <Limit> to place access controls on the PORT and PASV commands.  This
  applies to the EPRT and EPSV commands as well.
- Bug 2174 - mod_auth_unix should not act authoritatively.  This was causing
  problems when using mod_auth_unix.c and the AuthOrder configuration
  directive.
- Bug 2098 - Added SetEnv and UnsetEnv configuration directives.
- Bug 2271 - Improper autoconf check for getaddrinfo() on Tru64 UNIX 5.1.
  The getaddrinfo symbol is a macro, not a function, on that platform.
- Bug 2255 - RADIUS Service-Type should reflect attribute expectations.
- Added Event API.
- Bug 2272 - Address/port collision check needs to handle DefaultAddress.
- Bug 2072 - Add Controls API.
  This API includes a new program, ftpdctl, that is used to communicate
  directly with the proftpd daemon via a new core module, mod_ctrls.  For
  this new functionality to be used, proftpd must be configured using the
  added --enable-ctrls option.
- Bug 2015 - Add AND, OR keywords to Allow/DenyUser directives.
  The AllowUser, DenyUser, AllowGroup, and DenyGroup directives now take
  an optional keyword that indicates what type of expression they are:
  AND, OR, or regex.  By default, AllowUser and DenyUser are OR expressions,
  and AllowGroup and DenyGroup are AND expressions.  For example:

    AllowUser regex ^ftp
    DenyUser AND dave,bob
    AllowGroup OR web,doc

  These demonstrate that the optional keyword modifier must be the first
  parameter in the configuration directive.
- Bug 2046 - Change RFNR and RNTO logging class to WRITE.  This means that
  ExtendedLogs that use the WRITE logging class will now include the
  RNFR and RNTO commands.
- Mac OS X 10.3 portability fixes.
- Bug 2274 - Default server only binds to one IP address of host if
  the --enable-ipv6 configure option is used.  ProFTPD will now properly
  bind to all addresses for the default "server config" server.
- Bug 2048 - Add ability to get configuration file values from environment.
  For example, you can now have the following in your proftpd.conf:

    DefaultAddress %{env:PR_DEFAULT_ADDR}

  which indicates to ProFTPD's configuration parser to get the value of
  the PR_DEFAULT_ADDR environment variable, and substitute it in, e.g.:

    PR_DEFAULT_ADDR=1.2.3.4 ./proftpd ...

  If the indicated environment variable is not present, the value is
  substituted with the empty string.
- Bug 1635 - Older systems' chown(1) does not support -h option.  The solution
  is to prevent this error from stopping the 'make install' process, as it
  is a harmless error on such systems.
- Bug 2290 - gmtime() static storage may be overwritten by modules.
- Bug 2288 - ServerFQDN set to 255.255.255.255 and not hostname.
- Added mod_quotatab to the contrib area.
- Bug 2300 - poll() returns 1 and read returns 0, resulting in an infinite
  loop.  The actual bug was caused by a goto that was being inappropriately
  used; a return value was not being checked to see if it was an error value.
- Bug 2305 - Compile Problems since > 1.2.9
  Fix the build under Solaris - ftpdctl needs to be linked against libsocket
  and libnsl.
- Bug 2267 - Broken IP subnet matching. Added new ACL parsing/matching code.
- Bug 2307 - MySQL 4.1.1 API change causes mod_sql_mysql compilation failure.
- Bug 2319 - Build scripts have owner-only execute permission.  This was
  causing problems whenever a user other than the owner of the files
  attempted to build proftpd.
- Bug 2320 - autoconf check for socklen_t doesn't work on FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE.
  The fix is to include <sys/types.h>, if present, sooner in the check.
- Bug 1925 - Clean up of Class code.  The Class and Classes directives are
  now deprecated.  See README.classes for more details.
- Bug 2295 - mod_tls returns multiline response to AUTH commands.
- Bug 2322 - NLST -a returns listing formatted for LIST -a.  RFC959 does not
  explicitly allow dash-style options for LIST or NLST, although many clients
  attempt to use them.  De facto FTP server behaviors handle options for LIST;
  options for NLST will be explicitly rejected.
- Bug 2315 - Overlapping virtual server causes error.  If a <VirtualHost>
  was configured to handle the same IP address and port as the "server config"
  server, the wrong server configuration was being removed.
- Bug 2324 - Directories whose names contain whitespace are inaccessible.
- Bug 2306 - ftpcount output should handle case of no users.  When no clients
  are connected, ftpcount now displays "0 users".
- Bug 2337 - TLSRenegotiate parameters not processed correctly.
- Bug 2340 - Problem with parallel builds.  Proper dependencies added when
  building ftpwho and ftptop.
- Bug 2327 - SQLNegativeCache causes unnecessary errors in server logging.
- Bug 2237 - HiddenStores does not check for existing file in edge case.
- Bug 2171 - Add delete options to ftpasswd.  The ftpasswd script now
  supports the --delete-user and --delete-group options.
- Bug 2105 - Remove Authoritative directives.  The AuthPAMAuthoritative
  directive, and the "*" syntax of SQLAuthenticate, have been deprecated.
- Bug 1696 - Include directive should support directories.  The Include
  directive now functions just like Apache's Include directive, including
  handling glob characters.
- Bug 2311 - MaxClients counts unauthenticated users.  According to the
  documentation, the MaxClients configuration directive should only count
  authenticated clients.
- Bug 2339 - STAT command doesn't follow RFC959.  Previously, ProFTPD did
  not support use of the STAT command during file transfers.  This
  functionality is now implemented.  Sites wishing to prevent this can
  limit use of the STAT command by using <Limit STAT>.
- Bug 2257 - Add SITE SYMLINK command to mod_site.  Rather than adding
  this command to the mod_site module, a new module, mod_site_misc, has
  been added to the contrib area.  The mod_site_misc module implements
  SITE SYMLINK, and a few other SITE commands.  See contrib/mod_site_misc.html
  for details.
- Bug 2355 - Send error message to client when 'TLSRequired on' is in effect.
  Previously, if SSL/TLS was configured to be required for both control
  and data channels, if the client did not perform the SSL/TLS handshake for
  a data transfer, the connection would hang.  Now, an error message is sent
  to the client if no handshake is done.
- Bug 2353 - REST doesn't handle offsets greater than 2 GB.
- Bug 2357 - ftptop should use COLS for determining display width.
- Bug 2321 - FTP permission checks inconsistent for DELE and RMD/XRMD when
  symlink is in directory path.  This bug affected the RNFR command as well.
- Bug 2361 - Second USER command causes problems with chrooted session.
- Bug 2363 - ABOR response RFC 959 compliance.  The 226 response was being
  sent before closing the data connection; RFC 959 implies that the data
  connection is closed first.
- Bug 2369 - EPSV should not send network address when MasqueradeAddress is
  used.  RFC 2428 does not address the case where a server may wish to
  return an address in the EPSV response that differs from the control
  connection address, as is done in a PASV response for forwarding devices
  (e.g. NAT, firewall).  Until the proper behavior can be determined,
  do not honor MasqueradeAddress for EPSV.
- Bug 2367 - LIST *.* strange behaviour.  The builtin listing mechanism
  was inadvertently recursing into globbed directories when recursion was
  not actually requested.
- Bug 2371 - ftpasswd should have option to compare password against value
  in passwd file.  ftpasswd now supports a --not-previous-password option.
- Added a `howto' directory under `doc/', for mini-HOWTOs.
- Bug 2221 - proftpd on hp-ux 11.22.  The default data type of socklen_t
  on HP-UX 11 is problematic; many system calls expect an int, and the
  default type is a size_t.  This mismatch causes problems for 64-bit
  builds.
- Bug 2385 - Renames fail with error "Invalid cross-device link".
- Bug 2383 - mod_ctrls.c: ctrls_listen(): Invalid size in bind() argument.
  The size of struct sockaddr_un is not consistent across platforms.
- Bug 2387 - PRIVS_USER macro should set effective GID to user's primary GID.
- Added a `modules/' directory under `doc/', for core module documentation.
  Currently there are HTML docs for mod_auth_file, mod_cap, and mod_ctrls.
- Bug 2317 - Wrong order of privs calls on HP generates "unable to setregid()"
  error.

1.2.9 - Released 31-Oct-2003
---------------------------------
- Bug 2181 - The prior fix for Bug#2181, handling of the PORT command when the
  --enable-ipv6 configure option is used, was not quite correct.  A problem
  still existed when an IPv4 client used the PORT command when talking to
  an IPv4-only vhost (as opposed to an IPv4 and IPv6 vhost).  Now PORT is
  properly handled in all cases.
- Bug 2204 - On systems that use the gethostbyname2() function, IPv4 clients
  were not being properly resolved to their DNS names.
- Bug 2242 - proftpd reread included additional config as user nobody instead
  of root.  The bug was caused by configuration directive handlers
  (specifically, SyslogFacility and SystemLog) that would incorrectly change
  the process privileges; depending on the order of configuration in
  proftpd.conf, some Included files might not be parseable due to permissions
  problems.
- Bug 2197 - The RPM .spec has been updated for easy RPM builds from CVS
  snapshots.
- Check for excessive length of symlink directory listing entries (submitted
  by Michael Hendrickx <michael@scanit.be>)
- Two memory leaks, seen mostly during recursive directory listings, have
  been fixed.

1.2.9rc3 - Released 15-Oct-2003
---------------------------------
- Bug 2167 - getnameinfo() on FreeBSD doesn't support IP address lookups.
- Bug 2176 - getnameinfo() error on Cygwin during startup.
  The sa_family member of the address was not being properly initialized
  in some instances.
- Bug 2179 - ROOT_UID instead of ROOT_GID used in setegid() call.
  This affects Cygwin installations.
- Fixed ASCII file remote exploit discovered by X-Force at ISS:
    http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/154
- Bug 2181 - IPv4 active transfers don't work when using --enable-ipv6.
  IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses were not being properly compared for active
  data transfers.
- Bug 2200 - Correct segfaults with xlate_ascii_write() on IRIX.
- Bug 2024 - DefaultServer not functioning properly.
  The addition of the Bindings API in 1.2.8rc1 inadvertently caused the
  DefaultServer directive to not be properly honored in some configurations.
- Bug 2183 - Directory configuration lookups broken in 1.2.9rc2 (same as
  Bug 2165).
- Bug 2191 - Segfault in mod_sql_mysql when using 'Backend' SQLAuthType.
  This happens only with MySQL 4.1.  In MySQL 4.1, the way in which MySQL
  handles its passwords changed, and mod_sql_mysql was using the new
  interface incorrectly.
- Bug 2202 - AllowLogSymlinks check is flawed.
  Calling open(2) on a path that is a symlink will follow that symlink;
  the AllowLogSymlink check assumed that open() did not follow the symlink.
  The fix is to use the O_NOFOLLOW flag when opening log file paths.  However,
  this flag does not exist on Solaris machines, and so there still exists
  a race condition on Solaris when checking that a log path is not a symlink.
- Bug 2188 - Wildcard sockets not properly handled on FreeBSD.
  Similar to bugs 2167, the sin_len/sin6_len members of socket structures
  were not being properly set for wildcard sockets.
- Bug 2204 - Reverse DNS lookups not happening properly on connected clients
  on FreeBSD.  The gethostbyname2() function needs to be used on FreeBSD.
- Bug 2222 - Overlapping vhosts should warn instead of die.
  Prior to 1.2.9rc1, it was possible to have multiple vhosts configured that
  resolved to the same IP address/port combination.  This typically occurs
  when DNS names are used, and different DNS names resolve to the same IP
  address.  In 1.2.9rc1, these collisions are scanned for, and such collisions
  are treated as a fatal error.  With this change, such colliding vhosts
  are handled similar to vhosts that have unresolvable names: they are
  logged, then removed from the in-memory list of vhosts.

1.2.9rc2 - Released 11-Sep-2003
---------------------------------
- Bug 2051 - freebytes in TransferRate does not work properly.
- Bug 2043 - Proftpd converts LF to CRLF on PUT on Cygwin.  This turned out
  to be caused by the Cygwin layer.  The fix was to use the Cygwin-specific
  O_BINARY open() flag when opening binary files on Cygwin.
- Bug 1804 - Permit selection of additional contrib modules when building
  the RPM
- Bug 2074 - MaxStoreFileSize restriction capabilities ignored.  This bug
  was affecting MaxRetrieveFileSize as well.
- Bug 2075 - LIST / fails under Cygwin.  This was due to the addition of
  an additional path separator character; Cygwin treats paths that start
  with "//" differently than paths that start with "/".
- Bug 2076 - The --enable-transfer-buffer-size configure option doesn't work
  properly.  It was overriding the --enable-buffer-size option, rather than
  the corresponding tunable buffer size.
- Bug 2069 - Long MKD path causes truncated server response.
- Fixed handling of %N/%y in DisplayConnect files.
- Bug 2083 - "550 Access denied" on group permission with AuthGroupFile.  This
  was caused by a strictly linear search in the AuthGroupFile from the
  current file pointer to end of file, which (depending on the ordering of
  entries in the file) might have skipped necessary group entries.
- Bug 2088 - proftpd -t segfault.  A very specific configuration would cause
  a segfault in the configuration parser: if the first sub-context in a given
  context (e.g. a <Limit> context within a <Directory> context) was empty,
  the removal of that empty context from the internal structures by the
  parser would inadvertently trigger a segfault later.  This has been
  fixed by using a better memory pool, with a longer lifetime, for allocating
  the internal configuration structures.
- Bug 2090 - mod_rewrite doesn't compile on Solaris 8.  The FIONREAD macro
  was undefined, due to a strange necessity in the Solaris system headers
  for a missing flag.
- Bug 2100 - Invalid domain in <VirtualHost> tag causes segmentation fault.
- Fixed handling of mod_tls' TLSCertificateChainFile directive.
- Bug 2103 - AuthAliasOnly in server context causes hang.
- Bug 2110 - Segfault if gethostname(2) returns NULL.
- Bug 2113 - mod_sql default uses mysql keyword "password".  The default
  has been changed to "passwd".
- Bug 2115 - ftptop depends on snprintf but doesn't link in lib/libsupp.a
  on snprintf-less platforms
- Corrected handling of mod_tls' TLSCACertificateFile and TLSCACertificatePath
  directives so that they are properly allowed in <VirtualHost> and <Global>
  contexts.
- Bug 2119 - FEAT response format does not conform to RFC2389.  Extraneous
  leading whitespace removed.
- Fixed file descriptor leaks that occur if mod_tls encounters errors when
  handling CA certificate files.
- Bug 2118 - mod_sql's %F doesn't work for DELE command; %f is inconsistent.
  mod_sql's handling of cookies is now updated to match mod_log.
- Bug 1711 - IPv6 support.  Support for EPRT and EPSV added.  To enable IPv6
  support, use the new --enable-ipv6 configure option.
- Bug 2130 - %y in DisplayLogin is not updated correctly.
- Bug 2137 - NLST and IgnoreHidden causes segfault.
- Bug 2142 - sstrncpy() not available to lib/vsnprintf.c.  sstrncpy() is now
  implemented in the support library (libsupp.a).
- Bug 2144 - Rework autoconf handling of --enable-sia option.
- Bug 2147 - Segmentation fault processing file in ASCII mode.
- Fixed mod_ifsession's handling of multiple configuration sets.
- Bug 2148 - Enforce PR_TUNABLE_LOGIN_MAX.
- Bug 2141 - Glob Allow/Deny parameters cause extraneous log messages when
  comparing addresses.
- Bug 1804 - RPM spec file improvements
  The spec file now has xinetd support, builds under newer version of RPM,
  installs standalone support with the main proftpd RPM, and accepts --with
  mod_modname arguments during the build process.
- Bug 2127 - Entry in the file section
  The RPM spec's %files section now honors the install prefix.
- Bug 2108 - IgnoreHidden should not hide dotfiles
  Dotfiles are now displayed when the -a argument is supplied, even when the
  IgnoreHidden directive is enabled. To replicate the old behavior of hiding
  dotfiles no matter what, use either of the following directives:
    ListOptions "" strict
    HideFiles ^\..*
- Bug 2146 - DNS names not handled properly when --enable-ipv6 is used
  DNS names with both A and AAAA records were not being properly handled;
  listening sockets for both the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were not being
  established.
- Bug 2007 - autoconf header detection problem.
  On FreeBSD and other platforms, changes in autoconf require that headers
  be included in the proper order during configure's check.
- Bug 2153 - Small error in handling PR_AUTH_RFC2228 authentication code
- Bug 2154 - SQL query loses shell information.
  An index was not being properly incremented in some cases when retrieving
  user information.
- Bug 2161 - Duplicate autoconf check for sia.h.
- Bug 2122 - EAGAIN on Solaris can cause an infinite loop.
  Under certain conditions, when reading from a descriptor on Solaris,
  EAGAIN can be returned, which proftpd did not handle properly.

1.2.9rc1 - Released 15-May-2003
---------------------------------
- Bug 1828 - mod_sql can only find mysql.sock if in /tmp.  This was caused
  by the fact that mod_sql_mysql did not load/read the MySQL .cnf
  configuration files.  Now, when starting, mod_sql_mysql will read .cnf
  files for "client" sections.
- Bug 1960 - Add removed file size by DELE command to xferlog.
- Bug 1967 - Add display of uptime to ftpwho, ftptop.
- Added AnonRejectPasswords directive.
- Added ftpshut -R command-line option, for deleting the ftpshut shutdown
  file.
- Bug 1972 - %T not correctly shows time at performance of a command "rename".
  This was due to improper use of uninitialized data.
- Bug 1794 - Scoreboard format changes.
- Bug 1979 - Add TLSTimeoutHandshake directive.  This adds a directive to
  configure a timer when SSL/TLS handshakes are occurring, to prevent
  a malicious client from attempting to DOS a TLS-enabled server.  The default
  timeout is 5 minutes.
- Bug 1869 - Add option "-S/--server" to ftpcount, ftptop, ftpwho.  This
  option can be used to specify a ServerName; the utilities will then
  display information for that specific server.
- Bug 1980 - Login with incorrect password possible when using mod_radius.
  This was caused by the retaining of the OK state when a user authenticated
  via RADIUS, but the login process later fails (e.g. home directory
  inaccessible or something similar); subsequent logging in as a different
  user would succeed because the OK flag was not cleared.
- Added contrib module mod_ifsession-0.9rc6.
- Bug 1932 - Make Max* checks a PASS POST_CMD handler.  One of the consequences
  of this change is that the Max* limits will always be enforced after the
  PASS command has been sent, not after the USER command (as used to be done).
  Also, MaxHostsPerUser and MaxClientsPerUser limits will be determined using
  the locally resolved username, not using any user aliases.
- ProFTPD now checks for IP address/port collisions in the configuration
  file, and will refuse to start unless all configured server contexts
  have unique IP address/port combinations.
- Bug 1969 - Add scoreboard-scrubbing timer.  The scoreboard will be scanned
  now every 30 seconds for entries with invalid PIDs; this timer can be
  adjusted using the PR_TUNABLE_SCOREBOARD_SCRUB_TIMER #define.
- Bug 1921 - Socket-level performance tweaks.  This change deprecates the
  tcpReceiveWindow and tcpSendWindow configuration directives, replacing
  them with a single SocketOptions configuration directive.  This new
  directive can be used to tune the TCP send and receive window sizes as well
  as the TCP max segment size.  A new configure option,
  --enable-transfer-buffer-size, is also added, to be used for tuning the
  size of internal buffers used for file transfers.  Using this option to
  configure an 8K buffer size often results in higher transfer speeds.
- Bug 1849 - Compile can have trouble finding mysql.h.  The MySQL backend
  module was assuming that mysql.h would be found in a directory named
  "mysql"; for some distributions this is not the case.  Similarly for
  the Postgres backend module and the libpq-fe.h file.  Users may need to
  alter the --with-includes configure option used when building mod_sql.
- Bug 1915 - Unsafe pointer usage in scoreboard file format.
- Bug 1983 - Filenames beginning with '#' fail to upload/download.
- Bug 1985 - mod_rewrite fails to build on platforms without flock().
- Bug 1730 - mod_sql_mysql logging of long transfers fails.  This turned out
  to be caused by the default MySQL timeouts on non-interactive sessions
  (8 hours).  The fix involves marking mod_sql_mysql sessions as interactive;
  this means that users may use the 'interactive-timeout' option in their
  .cnf files to override the default interactive session timeout (also 8 hours).
- Bug 1989 - SQLLog '*' doesn't match any commands.
- Bug 1986 - mod_rewrite backreferences not zero-based (use $1 not $0?). The
  bug here turned out to be an off-by-one offset; mod_rewrite was starting
  at 1 when examining matched groups, rather than 0.  Most of the time $0 will
  not be what is desired, however, for $0 refers to the original string being
  matched.
- Bug 1987 - mod_rewrite seems not to handle more than one backreference.
- By default, mod_tls will now turn manually turn RSA blinding on, when
  OpenSSL older than 0.9.7b is used, in order to thwart certain timing attacks
  possible against RSA operations. The following URL contains more information:
  http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030317.txt
- Bug 1995 - incorrect handling of curses/ncurses header and libraries in
  ftptop
- New mod_radius directives: RadiusGroupInfo, RadiusVendor.  mod_radius
  now looks for custom response information in Vendor-Specific Attributes
  (VSAs) rather than the normal RADIUS attributes; VSAs are more flexible.
- Fixed a bug with mod_tls' use of SSL_shutdown(), to prevent it from hanging
  when interacting with some buggy FTPS clients (e.g FlashFXP, SmartFTP)
- Bug 1935 - mod_ls memory leak.  When a recursive directory listing is
  requested (and allowed), proftpd would use its memory pool system,
  allocating memory for every file to be listed.  For large/deep directory
  structures, this memory usage could grow quite large.  And, due to the
  way in which the underlying memory allocator (the C library, usually)
  works, that memory is never really released back to the operating system.
  This means that tools like ps and top reporting a never-shrinking memory
  footprint for the process.  To help alleviate this, proftpd has been
  altered to use malloc/realloc when providing recursive directory listings,
  making the memory footprint a little smaller.  The caching behavior of
  the underlying memory allocator cannot be changed, though.
- Bug 1997 - UnixWare 7.1.3 & port 20.
- Bug 1998 - Add ListOptions for setting limits on -R listings.  New
  keywords have been added to the ListOptions directive: maxdepth, maxdirs,
  and maxfiles.
- Bug 2011 - No "FTP session closed." msgs written to logfile.  This affected
  only inetd-run servers.
- Added two new configure options, --disable-curses and --disable-ncurses.
  By default, ftptop will use ncurses if available, then curses (if available).
  In some cases, both curses and ncurses may be present, and yet the admin
  would prefer ftptop to use curses.  Using the above options, one can
  disable ftptop's use of ncurses or curses, as needed.
- Bug 2016 - man pages should be autogenerated to reflect the --prefix used.
- Bug 2018 - Incorrect caching of TransferRate values.
- Bug 1813 - configure code: mistake in BSD sendfile semantic detection.
- Bug 2019 - proftpd support for Solaris 8/9 native sendfile
- Bug 2002 - Per-<Directory> PathAllowFilter/PathDenyFilter.
- Added RootRevoke directive.
- Bug 2021 - Inetd mode and scoreboard format changes.
- Bug 1532 - Human readable disk free cookie.  Display* files can now make
  use of a %f magic cookie for displaying the available disk space with
  units (i.e. KB, MB, GB, etc).  This compliments the currently available
  %F cookie, used to display the number of bytes of available space (without
  units).
- Bug 2003 - mod_auth.c does not compile for cygwin on W2K.
- Bug 2029 - Rewrite rule may execute more than once if multiple
  RewriteConditions exist.  This turned out to be caused by mod_rewrite's
  merging down of its directives, and the way in which multiple occurrences
  of directives are handled.  Now, even for merged-down mod_rewrite directives,
  a given RewriteRule will only be processed once.
- Fixed minor fd leak where listening socket descriptors were not being
  properly closed in a session process, when the session is first starting.
- Cygwin compilation/portability fixes.
- Fixed bug where AllowForeignAddress was not properly blocking "bounce"
  attacks in some cases.  Patch contributed by Patrick Hardy <kaber@trash.net>.
- Bug 2032 - AuthOrder not working when first option is mod_auth_file.c.  This
  was caused by mod_auth_file's returning of an ERROR condition, rather than
  DECLINED, when the module could not obtain the user's encrypted password
  for verification.
- Bug 2047 - 1024 or more chars in .ftpaccess causes lockup.  Certain conditions
  allowed for parsing of configuration files to enter an infinite loop.
- Bug 2031 - Add support for flags for RewriteCondition, RewriteRule
  (a la Apache's mod_rewrite).  mod_rewrite now supports various tests that
  can be used in RewriteConditions, the NC and OR flags for RewriteConditions,
  and the NC and L flags for RewriteRules.
- Bug 1977 - Add %u variable support in configuration file.  With this feature,
  one can configure DefaultRoot paths such as /home/%u/public_ftp, and the
  %u variable will be expanded to the logged in user name.

1.2.8 - Released 04-Mar-2003
---------------------------------
- Bug 1863 - Unable to build under UnixWare 7
- Bug 1943 - Unable to install on FreeBSD 5.0.  FreeBSD 5.0's header files
  have been rewritten, and glibc's glob.h collided with the new files.  The
  fix was simply to use size_t, rather than trying to determine and use
  __size_t (glob.h was intended to be used during library compilation, not
  during application compilation).
- Bug 1950 - OSX setgrent(3) returns int, causing compiler warning.  Unlike
  most other Unix flavours (but like FreeBSD), OSX's setgrent(3) returns
  int, rather than void.  A configure check was written to test for this. 
- Bug 1949 - Compiler warns of 'long double' usage on OSX.  Typecasts have
  been added to quell some warnings, and an autoconf check added for compiler
  support for -Wno-long-double to quell others.
- Bug 1952 - Umask Bug: Server Not Honoring VirtualHost Umask.  This was
  a statcache caching effect bug.
- Bug 1916 - Transfers hang with strange transfertime in logfile.  This
  appears to have been due to use of an uninitialized value.
- Bug 1948 - mod_xfer relinquishes privs before chmod takes place.  In
  places where UserOwner is used to "give away" files, the chmod() attempt
  that follows the chown() (used to preserve permissions sometimes altered
  by the operating system's chown(2) call) did not use root privs, and thus
  the client did not have permission to write the file.
- Added FTPS FEAT responses, as per Section 5 of the FTPS Draft.
- Bug 1956 - Upload transfer rate broken.  The wrong variable was being used.
- Bug 1941 - SCO OpenServer 5.0.5 issues.  Fixing this bug required adding
  more autoconf portability checks.
- Bug 1958 - ftpwho -o oneline has newlines when client is idle.
- Bug 1908 - ExtendedLog to work properly again in <Anonymous> context.
- Bug 1966 - SCO OpenServer 5.0.5 and inetd.
- Bug 1953 - STAT -R does not work.  There were some variable initialization
  issues in the handling of options for the STAT command.
- Bug 1970 - Transfer time wraps around and causes problems with transfer
  speed calculation.  This was a reporting problem, mostly.  An internal
  variable was storing time in microseconds; now using milliseconds.
- Bug 1937 - Transfer hangs when using TransferRate limits on a resumed
  download.  This turned out to be a misuse of the resumed file position
  when calculating the TransferRate.
- Bug 1964 - When uploading to an NFS mounted file system in passive mode
  read() get EAGAIN and closes connection.  This turned out to be caused
  by control messages in the STREAMS device (and thus relevant only to
  systems that use STREAMS).
- Portability fixes for FreeBSD-5.0.
- Bug 1976 - Login hangs, spawned process runs in endless loop in mod_auth.
  This was caused by a combination of "AuthAliasOnly on" and UserAlias
  directives in which the alias and the username were identical.  Different
  alias and username in a UserAlias directive is now required.

1.2.8rc2 - Released 29-Jan-2003
---------------------------------
- Bug 1894 - Double chdir into self-referencing symlink fails with
  "No such file or directory".  The errno value has been changed from
   ENOENT to ELOOP.
- Bug 1272 - Requested Addition: DenyFilter by User or DenyFilter by Directory.
  AllowFilter and DenyFilter are now extended to <Directory> and .ftpaccess
  contexts.
- Bug 1671 - new directive SQLLogFile.
- mod_linuxprivs has been renamed to mod_cap and is now built into ProFTPD
  by default if the host OS (Linux) supports it. autoconf detection code
  based on a submission by Mihai RUSU <dizzy@roedu.net>.  The mod_cap
  directives are CapabilitiesEngine and CapabilitiesSet.
- Bug 1893 - Apple likes to move things. PAM support works on OS X again.
  Submitted by: thesin@users.sourceforge.net (Justin F. Hallett)
- Bug 1826 - Makefiles are a bit icky
- Bug 1904 - Tru64 UNIX 4.0D and sstrncpy()
- Bug 1891 - SGI syslog isn't being written to.  Turns out that /dev/log on
  SGI is a STREAMS device, just as for Solaris.  The fix for this bug works
  for IRIX6; earlier versions of IRIX may still see this bug.
- Bug 1919 - <Directory> section already configured for $dir needs
  clarification.  This has been resolved by adding a debug statement (level 2)
  to the <Directory> handler that reports on the given/resolved paths used.
- Bug 1910 - ProFTPD hangs on SIGHUP.  This was triggered by mixing stdio
  and regular I/O library calls related to password and group entries.
- Add -Wundef and -Wfloat-equal to CFLAGS (Suggested by Steve Grubb
  <linux_4ever@yahoo.com>)
- Fixed broken tcpReceiveWindow and tcpSendWindow configuration directives.
  The setsockopt(2) function was being called at the wrong time during the
  establishment of the data connection.
- %f for DELE commands was not being properly expanded.
- Bug 1923 - %N magic cookie reports incorrectly.  This was an off-by-one
  bug.
- %L was reporting the remote IP address, rather than the local IP address.
- Bug 1922 - Server allows RNTO an existing file even with AllowOverwrite
  turned off.  Now, RNTOs to existing files are denied unless AllowOverwrite
  is on.
- ftptop now displays transfer rates in it's "transfer speed" display mode.
  Use the 't' key to toggle between ftptop display modes.
- Bug 1926 - AuthOrder doesn't work
- Bug 1918 - AuthUserFile not works normally.
- Bug 1241 - Additional functionality: HomedirOnDemand.  This has been added
  as a new configuration directive, CreateHome.
- Bug 1734 - Cygwin - Unable to set uid
- Bug 1938 - upload to root directory fails.  This was caused by caching
  effects.
- Bug 1939 - RLimitMemory seems broken.  The problem turned out to be bad
  handling of the case where sizes were used without specifying units.
- Bug 1911 - NLST is not being Limited in DIRS.  The issue was that directory
  paths were not being properly expanded, for purposes of looking up <Limit>s,
  in the handling of NLST.

1.2.8rc1 - Released 28-Dec-2002
---------------------------------
- Bug 1597 - Problems with HP-UX 10/11 trusted systems, mod_pam, and mod_unixpw.
- Bug 1482 - Add new %U meta to LogFormat, for logging original username.
- Bug 1683 - Handling of VirtualHosts on startup.  Now, rather than dying
  when unable to resolve a <VirtualHost> DNS hostname when starting up, the
  daemon will log the error, and skip the bad <VirtualHost>.
- Bug 1825 - AUTH macro namespace cleanup.  A "PR_" prefix has been added to
  the AUTH_* macros, to help prevent namespace collisions.  This means that
  some third-party auth modules may need to be updated.
- Bug 1806 - Add RFC2389 support.
- Bug 1833 - Add ability to have add'l module initialization callback.
- Bug 1743 - No magic cookie for number of files transfered.  New cookies
  added for Display* files: "%i" for total number of files uploaded (read "in")
  during a session, "%o" for total number of files download (written "out")
  during a session, and "%t" for total number of files transferred (both
  uploaded and downloaded).
- Bug 1653 - Complete the FS API abstraction implementation.  The Developer
  Guide will have the complete details on using this API.
- Bug 1712 - TLS support.  mod_tls-2.0.5 has been added to the distribution.
  Many, many thanks to Peter Runestig for his work on this, and for maintaining
  his code through so many versions of ProFTPD.
- Bug 1788 - Add ability to configure auth module checking order.  This is
  now configurable via the new AuthOrder directive.
- Bug 1205 - Add debug option to SystemLog.  Actually, this feature request
  has been resolved by adding a new DebugLevel configuration directive, so
  that a debugging verbosity can be set in the configuration file as well
  as on the command line.
- Added mod_rewrite to distribution.
- Bug 1403 - per-server system logs via ServerLog directive.
- Bug 1605 - MKD and RMD do not log filepaths with %f or %F option in
  ExtendedLog.
- Removing the RateRead* and RateWrite* configuration directives, and replacing
  them with a single new directive, TransferRate.
- Bug 1789 - Add ability to block recursive directory listings.  The
  LsDefaultOptions configuration directive has been deprecated in favor of
  the more feature-rich ListOptions directive.
- Added Bindings API
- Bug 1515 - Enable mod_log to log into default log / syslog.  The ExtendedLog
  directive can now take a "path" of the form: "syslog:level", where the
  "syslog:" prefix tells mod_log to log that ExtendedLog data via syslog,
  and the "level" informs mod_log of which syslog level to use.
- AIX sendfile support. Thanks to Andy Igoshin <ai@vsu.ru> for the patch.
- 1858 - move "session closed" logging from graceful quit to child exit
  sequence.  This allows for better log reporting, with respect to sessions
  ended through means such as catastrophic death of client, or segfaults.
- Added --enable-devel configure option, for enabling code of interest to
  developers
- Bug 1507 - regex pattern matching in [Allow/Deny][User/Group].  This has
  been implemented by adding a "regex" optional parameter to the AllowGroup,
  DenyGroup, AllowUser, and DenyUser directives.  The documentation will
  be adjusted accordingly.
- Bug 1882 - SITE chmod 777 file<space>name.  The patch for this works
  for filename parameters to the SITE CHGRP command as well.
- Bug 1881 - Bug in Function MaxClients.  This was caused by an off-by-one
  bug in the handling of non-anonymous settings.
- Bug 1886 - Ftpwho uses too many lines when authenticating.
- Bug 1875 - same radius packet id for start- and stop-accounting record.
- Bug 1883 - socklen_t patch. Thanks to Andy Igoshin <ai@vsu.ru> for the
  patch.
- Bug 1885 - -q/--quiet option for use with the -n/--nodaemon flag. Useful
  for running proftpd from inittab or with daemontools.
- Bug 1677 - Integrate ProFTPD with C2/SIA on Tru64 Unix.  The --enable-sia
  configure option has been added.
- Bug 1837 - Add module specifically for handling Auth*Files, providing
  finer-grained control.  The new mod_auth_file module is compiled in by
  default, and can be disabled using the --disable-auth-file configure option.
  For consistency, mod_unixpw.c has been renamed to mod_auth_unix (and now
  has a --disable-auth-unix configure option), and mod_pam.c has been renamed
  to mod_auth_pam.c (with an explicit --enable-auth-pam configure option).
- Bug 1900 - ftpwho's output on uploads.  ftpwho now reports "n/a" rather than
  "0%" on uploads, for the server does not know how large of a file is being
  uploaded in advance, and cannot determine a "percentage done" value.
- Bug 1888 - Increase mod_linuxprivs configurability.  Two new directives,
  LinuxPrivsEngine and LinuxPrivsCapabilities, are added.
- Bug 1905 - AIX needs "config.h" included before *anything* else.
- Bug 1903 - ftpwho depends on snprintf but doesn't link in lib/libsupp.a
  Primarily of issue under Solaris 2.5 and Tru64 4.0D.
- Bug 1863 - Unable to build under UnixWare 7
- Bug 1906 - Add description strings to AC_DEFINE

1.2.7 - Released 05-Dec-2002
----------------------------
- Bug 1840 - Problem with syslog default destination on HP-UX.  HPUX uses
  a default device of /dev/log.un rather than /dev/log.
- Bug 1844 - DisplayLogin %y macro is off by 1.  Consequence of scoreboarding
  code changes.
- Bug 1838 - Since 1.2.6: in add_useralias() setting flag CF_MERGEDOWN breaks
  aliased anonymous functionality.  The fix was to set the CF_MERGEDOWN flag
  only if the UserAlias directive is not being used in the <Anonymous>
  context.
- Bug 1812 - Double logging lines for ExtendedLog.  No need to merge this
  particular directive down.
- Bug 1848 - undefined reference to `halfdelay'. curses does not seem to
  provide this function, as ncurses does.  The patch works around this by
  using halfdelay() if linking against ncurses, and using nodelay() and sleep()
  if linking against curses.
- Bug 1839 - undefined reference to `get_fs_size'. Expand BSD
  statfs()/statvfs() support beyond FreeBSD.
- Bug 1680 - Error in startup script. Add /usr/local/sbin/ to the included
  rc script's $PATH
- Bug 1852 - Proftpd gets signal 11 on "quote site".  The mod_site module
  was not properly checking the number of parameters for SITE commands.
- Bug 1856 - TimesGMT acts like default is 'off'.  The default for this
  directive was inadvertently set to "off", rather than the documented default
  setting of "on".
- Bug 1853 - SyslogFacility: unable to open syslog.  This turned out to be
  due to the fact that /dev/log on Solaris (and other platforms?) is a
  STREAMS device, which requires open() and putmsg(), rather than connect()
  and send().
- 1846 - File overwrites fail.  Tracked down by Sergei Rozinov to involve
  uninitialized stack data.
- Bug 1861 - 'ftpwho -v -o oneline' print all connections in one line.  This
  bug appeared in 1.2.7rc3, a consequnce of Bug#1815.
- Bug 1868 - Wrong cmdopts in ftpcount.c.
- Added custom memory scrubber routine to deal with the issue mentioned in
  this Bugtraq thread: http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/298598

1.2.7rc3 - Released 15-Nov-2002
-------------------------------
- Fixed configure script detection and handling of ncurses (HAVE_LIBNCURSES
  was not being properly defined).
- Added --enable-scoreboard-buffer-size option to configure script, for
  tuning the size of some scoreboard fields (e.g. the full client command
  and the current working directory).
- Bug 1287 - Error compile with autoshadow option.  AIX does not have
  traditional shadow support, and uses other mechanisms.  This means that
  the --enable-autoshadow and --enable-shadow configure options should not
  be used when configuring proftpd for AIX.  The configure script has been
  updated to detect when these options are used on AIX, and to automatically
  disable them.
- Bug 1722 - Can't work magic cookie %F on FreeBSD.
- Make sure session.xfer uses cleared memory so unset structure members
  won't contain random values.
- Fixed handling of AuthAliasOnly, broken slightly by Bug#1567.
- Bug 1800 - Proftpd child segfaults when using a PASS without no USER first.
  mod_wrap was making a bad assumption about the USER name being available.
  This assumption has been corrected.
- Bug 1803 - Check for SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG to determine LFS support
  breaks some Linux installations
- Bug 1805 - PAM support under Mac OS X
- Bug 1772 - Docs fixup in RPM spec file
- Bug 1398 - there is no log rotate for /var/log/xferlog
- Bug 1814 - class names are truncated in scoreboard entry
- ftptop can now use either curses or ncurses
- Bug 1818 - proftpd doesn't compile on hpux11
- Bug 1760 - AllowOverwrite not operational.
- Bug 1703 - mod_sql_mysql compile error.  This was eventually tracked down
  to an overlap between ProFTPD's bundled getopt implementation, and
  MySQL's bundled getopt implementation.  To prevent this problem, a new
  --without-getopt configure option has been added, which tells the ProFTPD
  build process to explicitly not use the ProFTPD bundled getopt
  implementation.
- Only link ftptop with lib{n,}curses - it isn't needed in any other
  binaries
- Bug 1815 - Patch to add class information to ftpwho (with verbose on)
- Bug 1810 - Wrong permissions assigned to uploaded file.  This turned out
  to be related to the addition of the statcache code, and its interaction
  with the UserOwner and GroupOwner configuration directives.
- Bug 1830 - MaxClientsPerHost (small) Bug.  Off-by-one error in the handling
  of the MaxClientsPerHost directive, introduced by the change in timing of
  scoreboard modifications of the new scoreboarding code.
- ftpasswd now exits with different values, depending on the problem cause.
  Thanks to Graham Dunn <gdunn@inscriber.com> for these changes.

1.2.7rc2 - Released 22-Oct-2002
-------------------------------
- Bug 1757 - non-ANSI Syntax in netio.c
- Bug 1735 - Proftpd 1.2.6 compiled on FreeBSD 4.6.2 exits on signal 11
- Bug 1759 - ftpwho shows much more connections than really is.  This bug
             only occurred for those daemons running in inetd mode.
- Bug 1769 - Lack of supplemental groups can cause segfault.  This bug is
             a result of the fix for Bug 1666.
- Bug 1770 - Forgetting to check for no IP in string.
- Moved the switching to the User/Group for a vhost up in the order, to occur
  before any modules' session initialization callback is invoked.
- Bug 1644 - LogFormat local IP and FQDN tags missing.  Added %L to LogFormat
             meta sequences for logging local server IP address, and %V for
             logging local server FQDN.
- Bug 1785 - Bad handling of symlinks.  This bug appeared as a consequence
             of Bug#1486's fix, which involved caching of struct stats in
             order to effect a speed-up of directory listings.
- Bug 1778 - 1.2.7rc1 fails to link on OpenBSD 3.2-current.  The ftptop
             utility was not properly utilizing the macro detecting the
             presence (or absence) of the ncurses library.
- Adding new configure options (see configure --help) for setting some of
  the "tunable" values in options.h via the configure command.

1.2.7rc1 - Released 01-Oct-2002

1.2.6rc1 - Released 02-July-2002
--------------------------------
- Bug 1407 - Removed unnecessary check for prior PORT/PASV in STOR
             PRE_CMD handler (RETR PRE_CMD handler did not have these checks)
- Added new Define, <IfDefine>, <IfModule> configuration directives, new
  command-line option -D (a la Apache)
- Bug 1556 - Restructuring the way signals are handled, so that signal handling
             functions are executed synchronously, not asynchronously

- Bug 1569 - Cygwin support, added README.cygwin
- Bug 1171 - Added handling backslash-escaped newlines in configuration files,

             a trailing \ before the newline character.
- Removed the deprecated AllowChmod and ShowDotFiles configuration directives.
- Bug 1655 - Added support for a -n option when listing directories.
- Bug 1502 - Added a lingering_close function.  As discussed in the bug
             report, this may cause issues with some clients; keep an eye
             for this, as the timeout (ten minutes) may be too long or short.
- Bug 1664 - Changed mod_sql to decline UID-to-name resolution if a UID
             field has been configured to NULL; similarly for GID.

             causing some DefaultRoot directives (those that relied on
             group-expressions) not be correctly honored, as mod_sql was
             not supplying the groups for the users.
- Bug 1543 - Change mod_sql to not remove embedded whitespace within a
             username, just to strip leading and trailing whitespace.

1.2.1 - Released 01-Mar-2001
----------------------------
- A relatively major issue was discovered with session.groups which may cause
  any group-expressions inside of <Limit> (DenyGroup, etc) to malfunction.
  This is the primary reason for the 1.2.1 release.
- Default CFLAGS changed from "-g3 -O6" to "-O2" because it is reported
  that -O6 is highly experimental, and including debugging really isn't all
  the useful, as someone _really_ interested in debugging can edit Make.rules.
- Defining classes without an explicit "Classes On" now generates a log
  warning.
- New mod_sql and mod_ldap from their respective maintainers.

1.2.0-final - Released 26-Feb-2001
----------------------------------
- Numerous additional bug fixes from Bugzilla.  See http://bugs.proftpd.org
  for more info.
- New and updated README.* and INSTALL.
- initgroups() support has been removed, it will be re-added in 1.3 after we
  have proper modular support in authentication modules.
- mod_sql.c, mod_sql_mysql.c and mod_sql_postgres.c back in, with a new
  maintainer (replacements for mod_sqlpw and friends).
- instead of using kill(pid,SIGCONT) to determine if scoreboard pids are
  correct, proftpd now uses kill(pid,0) which should be a lot lighter on
  heavy-load systems.  Thanks to Rob Schulhof <rrs@digisle.net> for pointing
  out that kill(pid,0) is both valid AND useful. ;) Also removed some
  completely useless and redundant /proc stat code which did the same thing
  as kill(pid,0) on linux systems.
- logging to file (via SystemLog) is now done with a single write instead of
  two in order to be atomic.

1.2.0rc3 - Released: 05-Feb-2001
--------------------------------
- mod_sqlpw.c, mod_mysql.c and mod_pgsql.c have been REMOVED from the
  distribution.  They are currently unmaintained and have numerous bugs.
  If any kind soul <grin> is interested in maintaining them, they may be
  brought back into a future version of proftpd.
- sendfile now defaults to off, use --enable-sendfile at configure
  time to enable.  Additionally, sendfile is probably fixed.
- initgroups/getgroups new defaults to off, use --enable-initgroups at
  configure time to enable (mainly useful for large systems).  Be careful,
  though, as initgroups/getgroups breaks module handling and will not work
  in conjunction with other third-party modules (mod_sqlpw, etc).
- Passive FTP works properly now (was broken in RC2).
- Compilation problems fixed on some obscure platforms.
- PAM authentication finally works again on Solaris (due to an annoying bug in
  Solaris).

----------------------------------
- sendfile() handles errors and non-optimal conditions The Right Way(tm).
