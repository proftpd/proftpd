<p>
This module is contained in the <code>mod_auth_file.c</code> file for
ProFTPD 1.3.<i>x</i>, and is compiled by default.

<h2>Directives</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#AuthFileOptions">AuthFileOptions</a>
  <li><a href="#AuthGroupFile">AuthGroupFile</a>
  <li><a href="#AuthUserFile">AuthUserFile</a>

<h3><a name="AuthFileOptions">AuthFileOptions</a></h3>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> AuthFileOptions <em>opt1 ...</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> server config, <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Global&gt;</code><br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_auth_file<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.3.7rc1

<p>
The <code>AuthFileOptions</code> directive is used to configure various optional
behavior of <code>mod_auth_file</code>.

<p>
Example:
<pre>
  AuthFileOptions InsecurePerms
</pre>

<p>
The currently implemented options are:
<ul>
  <p>
  <li><code>CryptWithRoot</code></br>
    <p>
    When this option is used, <code>mod_auth_file</code> will call the
    <code>crypt(3)</code> library function with root privileges.  On some
    platforms, such as AIX, <code>crypt(3)</code> offers more functionality
    when used as root.

    <p>
    <b>Note</b> that this option first appeared in
    <code>proftpd-1.3.8rc1</code>.
  </li>

  <p>
  <li><code>InsecurePerms</code><br>
    <p>
    When this option is used, <code>mod_auth_file</code> will ignore insecure
    permissions (<i>i.e.</i> group- or world-readable) on
    <code>AuthUserFile</code> and <code>AuthGroupFile</code> files.  <b>Note</b>
    that this option <b>must</b> appear <em>before</em> any
    <code>AuthUserFile</code> and <code>AuthGroupFile</code> directives in
    order to function properly, for the option changes the behavior of the
    <code>mod_auth_file</code> module at <i>parse</i> time.

    <p>
    <b>Note</b> that this option first appeared in
    <code>proftpd-1.3.7rc1</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="AuthGroupFile">AuthGroupFile</a></h3>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> AuthGroupFile <em>path [id min-max] [name regex]</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> server config, <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Global&gt;</code><br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_auth_file<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.7rc2

<p>
The <code>AuthGroupFile</code> directive configures an alternate group file for
providing group membership information; the specified file must have the same
format as the system <code>/etc/group</code> file, and if specified is used
during authentication and group lookups for directory/access control
operations. The <em>path</em> argument should be the full path to the specified
file. This directive can be configured on a per-server basis, so that virtual
FTP servers can each have their own authentication file, often in conjunction
with an <a href="#AuthUserFile"><code>AuthUserFile</code></a>.

<p>
Note that this file does <i>not</i> need to reside inside a
<code>chroot()</code>ed directory structure for anonymous or
<code>DefaultRoot</code> logins, as it is held open for the duration of a
session.

<p>
The optional parameters are used to set restrictions on the contents of
the specified file.  The <em>id</em> restriction is used to specify a range
of GIDs that may appear in the file; when doing a lookup, if a group entry
has a GID that is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum is
encountered, that entry is ignored.  The <em>name</em> restriction is used
to specify a regular expression that is applied to the name of a group
entry.  If the group name does not match the regular expression, the group
entry is ignored.  A leading <code>!</code> in the regular expression can
be used to negate the given expression.

<p>
Example:
<pre>
  # This makes an AuthGroupFile that can only have GIDs 2000 to 4000, and
  # whose groups must start with 'cust'
  AuthGroupFile /etc/ftpd/group id 2000-4000 name ^cust
</pre>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: In order to prevent other users from modifying the
<code>AuthGroupFile</code>, the <code>mod_auth_file</code> module
<b>requires</b> that the permissions on the file <b>not</b> be world-readable
<b>or</b> world-writable, <b>and</b> that the directory containing the
file <b>not</b> be world-writable.  In addition, if the file is not a file
(<i>e.g.</i> the path points to a symlink, or a FIFO, <i>etc</i>), a warning
will be logged on server startup/restart.

<h3><a name="AuthUserFile">AuthUserFile</a></h3>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> AuthUserFile <em>path [id min-max] [home regex] [name regex]</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> server config, <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Global&gt;</code><br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_auth_file<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.7rc2

<p>
The <code>AuthUserFile</code> directive configures an alternate passwd file for
providing user account information; the specified file must have the same
format as the system <code>/etc/passwd</code> file, and if specified is used
during authentication and user lookups for directory/access control operations.
The <em>path</em> argument should be the full path to the specified file. This
directive can be configured on a per-server basis, so that virtual FTP servers
can each have their own authentication file, often in conjunction with an
<a href="#AuthGroupFile"><code>AuthGroupFile</code></a>.

<p>
Note that this file does <i>not</i> need to reside inside a
<code>chroot()</code>ed directory structure for anonymous or
<code>DefaultRoot</code> logins, as it is held open for the duration of a
session.

<p>
The optional parameters are used to set restrictions on the contents of
the specified file.  The <em>id</em> restriction is used to specify a range
of UIDs that may appear in the file; when doing a lookup, if a user entry
has a UID that is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum is
encountered, that entry is ignored.  The <em>home</em> restriction is used
to specify a regular expression that is applied to the home directory of a user
entry.  If the home does not match the regular expression, the user entry
is ignored.  The <em>name</em> restriction is used to specify a regular
expression that is applied to the name of a user entry.  If the user name does
not match the regular expression, the user entry is ignored.  A leading
<code>!</code> in these regular expressions can be used to negate the given
expression.

<p>
Example:
<pre>
  # This makes an AuthUserFile whose user names must start with 'ftp', and
  # whose homes cannot start with /home.
  AuthUserFile /etc/ftpd/passwd name ^ftp home !^/home
</pre>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: In order to prevent other users from modifying the
<code>AuthUserFile</code>, the <code>mod_auth_file</code> module
<b>requires</b> that the permissions on the file <b>not</b> be world-readable
<b>or</b> world-writable, <b>and</b> that the directory containing the
file <b>not</b> be world-writable.  In addition, if the file is not a file
(<i>e.g.</i> the path points to a symlink, or a FIFO, <i>etc</i>), a warning
will be logged on server startup/restart.

<h2><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h2>
The <code>mod_auth_file</code> module is compiled by default.

<p>
<b>Logging</b><br>
The <code>mod_auth_file</code> module supports <a href="../howto/Tracing.html">trace logging</a>, via the module-specific log channels:
<ul>
  <li>auth.file
</ul>
Thus for trace logging, to aid in debugging, you would use the following in
your <code>proftpd.conf</code>:
<pre>
  TraceLog /path/to/ftpd/trace.log
  Trace auth.file:20
</pre>
This trace logging can generate large files; it is intended for debugging use
only, and should be removed from any production configuration.

<p><a name="FAQ">
<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><br>

<p><a name="Password8Characters">
<font color=red>Question</font>: I found that only the first 8 characters of
passwords are used! This is a security bug!<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: No, it is not.

<p>
The default Unix password hashing scheme uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard">Data Encryption Standard</a> (DES) algorithm.
As per the <code>crypt(3)</code> man page, <b>only the first 8 characters
of the password are used</b>.  Thus this 8 character limitation comes from
the underlying system authentication, <b>not</b> from proftpd.  The whole
purpose of the PAM system was to enable replacing the use of DES with other
authentication algorithms, which do not have this 8 character limitation.

<p>
Later, other <code>crypt(3)</code> implementations were made which can also
support algorithms such as MD5, or Blowfish.  Some platforms support these
enhanced versions of <code>crypt(3)</code>, some do not.  The
<a href="../utils/ftpasswd.html"><code>ftpasswd</code></a> script can generate
<code>AuthUserFiles</code> which use the MD5 algorithm instead of DES.

<p><a name="AuthFilePermissions">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Why does <code>mod_auth_file</code> refuse
to use an <code>AuthUserFile</code> (or <code>AuthGroupFile</code>) that is
world-readable/writable?  I see messages like the following logged:
<pre>
  mod_auth_file/1.0: unable to use world-readable AuthUserFile '/etc/proftpd/ftpd.passwd'
</pre>
or:
<pre>
  mod_auth_file/1.0: unable to use world-writable AuthUserFile '/etc/proftpd/ftpd.passwd'
</pre>
<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>:  If an <code>AuthUserFile</code> or
<code>AuthGroupFile</code> is world-writable, then <b>any user on the system
can edit that file</b>.  They can create new users, or change the entries
for existing users such that those users have different privileges, perhaps
even root privileges.  In short, having <code>AuthUserFile</code> or
<code>AuthGroupFile</code> with world-writable permissions is an unsafe
configuration, and now <code>mod_auth_file</code> prevents this.

<p>
If the <code>AuthUserFile</code> is world-readable, then <b>any user on the
system can read that file</b>, including the hashed password.  This can allow
for offline dictionary/cracking attempts against those hashes.  This is also an
unsafe configuration, and thus <code>mod_auth_file</code> does not allow
world-readable <code>AuthUserFiles</code>.

<p>
Similarly, <code>mod_auth_file</code> will refuse to use an
<code>AuthUserFile</code> or <code>AuthGroupFile</code> if that file lives
in a directory, and that directory has world-writable permissions (even if
the configured file itself is <b>not</b> world-writable).  A world-writable
directory would allow <b>any system user to delete the <code>AuthUserFile</code></b>, and add their own, or to add a symlink, <i>etc</i>.  It is another
unsafe configuration against which <code>mod_auth_file</code> now guards.
