>sendfile() is a system call which streamlines the copying of data
between the disk and the tcp socket.  The call copied from the page
cache directly rather than requiring a kernel -&#62; user space -&#62; kernel
space copy for every read() and write() call.  Generally the
advantages are only felt on heavily loaded servers.  The call is
supported in ProFTPD for Linux and FreeBSD.</P

This is an inbuilt limitation of the current FTP RFC., unlike the
HTTP/1.1 spec there is no mechanism comparable to the "Host:
foo.bar.com" HTTP header for specifying which host the connection is
for.  Therefore the only method for determining which VirtualHost the
connection is destined for is by the destination IP.</P

IP but using different ports, however this requires that the connecting

effects.  The cleanest approach on servers which have significant
amounts of traffic appears to be to use ftpshut to block new
connections and terminate existing ones after a pre-determined time
period and then to upgrade and restart.  This approach limits the
number of downloads which are terminated part way through.</P

></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>The setting of the group privileges for a process uses the setgroups(2)
   system call.  This call will fail with the above error message for
   one of two reasons: there is a negative GID value for one of the
   groups, or the maximum number of groups for a single user has been
   exceeded.</P
><P
>Ideally, all IDs, both UID and GID, will be positive.  Unfortunately,
   it is common on many systems to use -1 or -2, especially for such
   users as 'nobody', or group 'nogroup'.  Use of these values uses C's
   treatment of data types to make the actual numeric value very high;
   some functions, like setgroups(), do not like this, though.  In
   general, always use positive ID numbers.</P
><P
>The other limitation is the number of supplemental groups for a user
   (eg non-primary groups, the ones configured in /etc/group).  The
   maximum number of supplemental groups to which a user may belong
   is defined by the operating system constant NGROUPS_MAX.  On
   some operating systems, such as Solaris, this limitation may be
   tunable.</P
><P
>Some other applications may not encounter this error if they use the
   initgroups(3) function, which reads the /etc/group file for a user's
   supplemental group memberships, and sets those groups.  This function,
   however, silently ignores any supplemental groups for user greater than
   NGROUPS_MAX, unlike setgroups(2), which complains.</P
><P
>   If this is the cause of your error message, any solution will most
   likely involve reducing the number of groups your users are members of,
   or tuning the NGROUPS_MAX value, if your operating system allows it.</P

   utilities, such as PAM.  In this case, PAM's configuration is causing
   the PAM library to attempt to open PAM modules using a path that is
   no longer valid, thus the errors.  This happens on logout because the
   chroot has already happened by that point; on login, the PAM modules
   are successfully found and loaded before the chroot, so no errors.

>You'll need to configure your host to be able to handle multiple IP
addresses. This is often called "aliasing", and can generally be
configured through an IP alias or dummy interface. You need to read
your operating system documentation to figure out how to do this. Once
your have the host configured to accept the additional IP address that
you wish to offer a virtual FTP server on, use the &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
configuration directive to create the virtual server:</P

></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>The &lt;LOGIN&gt; directive is used to control connection or login
access to a particular context (the directive block which contains
it). When a client initially connects to ProFTPD, the daemon searches
the configuration tree for &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; directives, and
attached parameters (such as Allow, Deny, etc). If it determines that
there is no possible way for the client to ever be allowed to login,
such as a "Deny from" matching the client's source address, without an
overriding "Allow from" at a lower level, the client is disconnected
without being offered the opportunity to transmit a user and password.</P
><P
>However, if it is possible for the client to be allowed a login,
ProFTPD continues as per normal, allowing the client to login only if
the proper &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; applies. Normally, &lt;Limit&gt; directive blocks
are allowed in the server config, &lt;VirtualHost&gt;, &lt;Anonymous&gt;
and &lt;Directory&gt; contexts. However, &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; should not be
used in a &lt;Directory&gt; context, as clients do not connect/login to a
directory (and thus it is meaningless).</P
><P
>By way of example, the following configuration snippet illustrates a
&lt;Limit LOGIN&gt; deny which will cause any incoming connections from the
10.1.1.x subnet to be immediately disconnected, without a welcome
message:</P
><PRE

>For general open access you can use an &lt;Anonymous&gt; directive context block,

you can use the DefaultRoot directive.  DefaultRoot lets you specify a
root jailed directory (or "~" for the user's home directory), and an
optional group-expression argument which can be used to control which
groups of users the jail will be applied to. For example:</P

&lt;VirtualHost myhost.mynet.foo&gt;
DefaultRoot /u2/public users,!staff

>In this example, all users who are members of group "users", but
not members of group "staff" are jailed into /u2/public. If a user
does not meet the group-expression requirements, they login as per
normal (not jailed, default directory is their home).  You can use
multiple DefaultRoot directives to create multiple jails inside the
same directive context. If two DefaultRoot directives apply to the
same user, ProFTPD arbitrarily chooses one (based on how the
configuration file was parsed).</P

>The DefaultRoot directive is implemented using the chroot(2) system
call.  This moves the "/" (or root) directory to a specified point
within the file system and jails the user into this sub-tree.  However
this is not the holy grail of security, a chroot jail can be broken,
it is not a trivial matter but it's nowhere near impossible.
DefaultRoot should be used as part of a general system of security not
the only security measure.</P

>There are two methods of accomplishing this (possibly more).
First, you can create a directory structure inside your anonymous FTP
root directory, creating a single directory for each user and setting
ownership/permissions as appropriate. Then, either create a symlink
from each user's home directory into the FTP site, or instruct your
users on how to access their directory.</P
><P
>The alternate method (and more versatile) of accomplishing per-user
anonymous FTP is to use AnonymousGroup in combination with the
DefaultRoot directory. You'll probably want to do this inside a
&lt;VirtualHost&gt;, otherwise none of your users will be able to access
your system without being stuck inside their per-user FTP site.
Additionally, you'll want to use a deferred &lt;Directory&gt; block to
carefully limit outside access to each user's site.</P

CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>ProPTPD follows the UNIX file permission rules when determining the level of access and/or control a user is granted when working with a file.  UNIX systems divide the world into three classes when determining the permissions that a user is granted for a particular file:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>User - the owner of the file</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Group - a collection of users defined in /etc/group</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Others - neither the owner, nor a member of the group</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
>Every file in a Unix filesystem has a permission definition associated with it. At a minimum, the permission established for a file will determine whether a particular user may READ, WRITE, or EXECUTE the file in question.  A directory listing will show the permissions associated with a file in the format shown below:
<PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;  rwx  r-x  r-x
   |    |    |
   |    |    |_____________ Others:  READ/NO WRITE/EXECUTE
   |    |__________________ Group:   READ/NO WRITE/EXECUTE
   |_______________________ User:    READ/WRITE/EXECUTE&#13;</PRE
></P
><P
>In the sample directory listing shown below, READ/WRITE/EXECUTE privileges are granted to the owner of the directory, and READ/EXECUTE privileges are granted to members of the <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>users</TT
> group and everyone else.  Note the letter "d" at the beginning of each entry, denoting that the entry is actually a directory.

<PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

  drwxr-xr-x    2 andrea   users        4096 May  3 00:40 andrea

></P
><P
>The answer to this question is shown in the above example.  When describing the permissions associated with a directory, WRITE means that permission is granted to modify the contents of a directory by adding or deleting files.  Thus, the user <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>andrea</TT
> may delete the file <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>secret.txt</TT
>, even though she cannot modify the file itself.</P

>Security, pure and simple.  PAM is the most secure (or securable)
of the available authentication systems.  Many of the issues and
configuration hints for PAM are contained in README.PAM which is
bundled with the server source and in the various packaged builds.  To 
use /etc/passwd manual compilation will be required with the configure 
script being run with the --without-pam flag.  Unless the PAM
subsystem is properly configured authentication will fail.</P

   proftpd will perform PAM authentication by default.  However, this

   the AuthPAMAuthoritative configuration directive.</P
