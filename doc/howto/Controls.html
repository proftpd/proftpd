<p>
<b>What Controls Are</b><br>
ProFTPD version 1.2.10rc1 introduced a new capability: Controls.  Controls
are a way to communicate directly with a standalone <code>proftpd</code> daemon
while it is running.  This provides administrators a way to alter the
daemon's behavior in real time, without having to restart the daemon and
have it re-read its configuration.  Changing log levels, kicking connected
clients, disabling individual virtual servers, <i>etc.</i> are all possible.
The Controls functionality includes an API that third-party modules can
use to add new control actions.

<p>
The functionality involves a client and a server communicating over a Unix
domain socket, using a simple text-based protocol.  A new program,
<code>ftpdctl</code>, is distributed with ProFTPD; <code>ftpdctl</code> is a
Controls client.  The server side of the Controls functionality is the
<a href="../modules/mod_ctrls.html"><code>mod_ctrls</code></a> module, which is
compiled into a <code>proftpd</code> daemon when the <em>--enable-ctrls</em>
configure option is used.  Note, however, that the Controls functionality only
works for <code>proftpd</code> daemons whose <code>ServerType</code> is
<code>standalone</code>; <code>proftpd</code> daemons run via inetd/xinetd
cannot support Controls and the <code>ftpdctl</code> program.

<p>
<b>Configuring <code>mod_ctrls</code></b><br>
Here's an example configuration for <code>mod_ctrls</code>:
<pre>
  &lt;IfModule mod_ctrls.c&gt;
    ControlsEngine        on
    ControlsACLs          all allow group ftpadm
    ControlsMaxClients    2
    ControlsLog           /var/log/proftpd/controls.log
    ControlsInterval      5
    ControlsSocket        /tmp/ctrls.sock
    ControlsSocketOwner   ftpd ftpd
    ControlsSocketACL     allow group ftpadm
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
The first configuration directive you will want to use is the
<code>ControlsEngine</code> directive, which enables the processing of
Controls requests by the engine within the <code>mod_ctrls</code>
engine.

<p>
When first configuring <code>mod_ctrls</code> and its modules, you will
probably want to configure a <code>ControlsLog</code>.  The
<code>mod_ctrls</code> modules will log any errors they have to this
file (unless the module has its own module-specific log), as well as all
control requests made using <code>ftpdctl</code>.  Like most
<code>proftpd</code> log files, the directive should use the full
path to the log file, and the file cannot be in a world-writeable directory.

<p>
The <code>ControlsInterval</code> directive configures how often
<code>mod_ctrls</code> checks for connecting clients such as
<code>ftpdctl</code>.  Often when using <code>ftpdctl</code>, the system
administrator may notice a long pause before <code>ftpdct</code> responds.
This delay is probably caused by the configured <code>ControlsInterval</code>.
A related directive is <code>ControlsMaxClients</code>, which sets how
many clients are handled at one time.  If more than the configured maximum
number of clients are attempting to send control requests,
<code>mod_ctrls</code> will wait to handle the remaining clients until its
next check.

<p>
The <code>ControlsSocket</code> directive is used to configure the path
to the Unix domain socket on which <code>mod_ctrls</code> should listen.
This path should be in a place where <code>ftpdctl</code> users have
access to it, and should have read and write permissions.  The
<code>ControlsSocketOwner</code> directive explicitly configures the
ownership the created Unix domain socket file should have.  This means
that the configuration above:
<pre>
  ControlsSocket        /tmp/ctrls.sock
  ControlsSocketOwner   ftpd ftpd
</pre>
overrides the default location of the Unix domain socket, and tells
<code>mod_ctrls</code> to use <code>/tmp/ctrls.sock</code>, and to make
the socket owned by user <code>ftpd</code> and group <code>ftpd</code>.
The default ownership of the socket is user <code>root</code>, group
<code>root</code>.

<p><a name="ACLs"></a>
<b>Controls Access Control Lists</b><br>
Communicating with the daemon process allows for some great features, but
it also allows the potential to easily abuse the system.  Thus, by default,
all users <b>including user <code>root</code></b> are denied access to all
<code>ftpdctl</code> actions.  <b>Access for control actions must be
explicitly granted.</b>  Also, be aware that the users and groups configured
in these ACLs are <b>system</b> users and groups, not the virtual users
and groups that <code>proftpd</code> may have been configured to use.
The group will be only the primary group of the user; supplemental group
memberships are currently ignored.

<p>
The <code>mod_ctrls</code> first checks whether the connecting client has
been granted the ability to use the Unix domain socket itself.  This access
list is controlled by the <code>ControlsSocketACL</code> directive.  By
default, every Controls client can use the socket.  Thus, in the example
configuration above:
<pre>
  ControlsSocketACL     allow group ftpadm
</pre>
only the system group <code>ftpadm</code> would be allowed to send Controls
requests to the Unix domain socket; all other users and groups will be
denied.

<p>
Next, ACLs on the specific control action requested by the connecting
client will be check.  Most modules that use the Controls API will have their
own module-specific directives for setting ACLs on the specific actions
implemented by that module.  For <code>mod_ctrls</code>, the
<code>ControlsACLs</code> configuration directive is used.  In the
example configuration we see:
<pre>
  ControlsACLs all allow group ftpadm
</pre>
which allows only the system group <code>ftpadm</code> to use all of the
control actions provided by <code>mod_ctrls</code>.  If one wanted to
allow all users to use all of the control actions, it would be:
<pre>
  ControlsACLs all allow user *
</pre>
However, if one wanted to specify separate ACLs for separate actions, then
the <code>ControlsACLs</code> directive would be used multiple times, like
so:
<pre>
  ControlsACLs insctrl allow group wheel
  ControlsACLs lsctrl allow user *
  ControlsACLs rmctrl deny group ftp
</pre>

<p>
Why is there such complexity for a simple client/server interaction?  The
primary answer is that the running <code>proftpd</code> daemon has a lot of
privileges, and access to the running daemon should be strictly controlled.
Allow few people to have access via control actions; those few should be able
to use only the control actions necessary.

<p>
<b>What Controls Do</b><br>
The <code>mod_ctrls</code> module provides basic control <em>actions</em>,
or commands that <code>ftpdctl</code> can send to the daemon:
<ul>
  <li><code>help</code><br>
    Lists all registered control actions and a brief description for each
  </li>

  <p>
  <li><code>insctrl</code><br>
    Re-enable a disabled control action
  </li>

  <p>
  <li><code>lsctrl</code><br>
    Lists all enabled control actions and the modules providing them
  </li>

  <p>
  <li><code>rmctrl</code><br>
    Disable a control action
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Denied Actions Versus Disabled Actions</b><br>
What is the difference between an action that has been denied via an ACL
versus an action that has been disabled using the <code>rmctrl</code> action?
A disabled action cannot be used by any client, regardless of any ACLs that
have been configured for that action.  Thus if a system administrator
deemed that a particular control action should not be used by anyone, that
action can be disabled.  The <code>rmctrl</code> action can disable <i>any</i>
action implemented by any module using the Controls API, not just actions
provided by <code>mod_ctrls</code>.  Once disabled, a given action can be
re-enabled using the <code>insctrl</code> action.  The <code>insctrl</code>
and <code>rmctrl</code> actions, in addition to <code>lsctrl</code>, cannot
themselves be disabled.  For example, to disable an action called
<code>foo</code>:
<pre>
  # ftpdctl rmctrl foo
  ftpdctl: 'foo' control disabled
  # ftpdctl lsctrl
  ftpdctl: help (mod_ctrls.c)
  ftpdctl: insctrl (mod_ctrls.c)
  ftpdctl: lsctrl (mod_ctrls.c)
  ftpdctl: rmctrl (mod_ctrls.c)
</pre>
Note that the <code>foo</code> action is not listed by <code>lsctrl</code>.
Now, re-enable that action:
<pre>
  # ftpdctl insctrl foo
  ftpdctl: 'foo' control enabled
  # ftpdctl lsctrl
  ftpdctl: foo (mod_foo.c)
  ftpdctl: help (mod_ctrls.c)
  ftpdctl: insctrl (mod_ctrls.c)
  ftpdctl: lsctrl (mod_ctrls.c)
  ftpdctl: permit (mod_ban.c)
  ftpdctl: rmctrl (mod_ctrls.c)
</pre>
And now the <code>foo</code> action, provided by the module
<code>mod_foo.c</code>, appears in the <code>lsctrl</code> listing.

<p>
The following shows an example of attempting to disable the <code>lsctrl</code>
action.  It demonstrates the use of the <code>-v</code> command-line
option for <code>ftpdctl</code>, for showing a verbose interaction with
<code>mod_ctrls</code>:
<pre>
  # ftpdctl -v lsctrl
  ftpdctl: adding &quot;lsctrl&quot; to reqargv
  ftpdctl: contacting server
  ftpdctl: sending control request
  ftpdctl: receiving control response
  ftpdctl: debug (mod_ctrls_admin.c)
  ...

  # ftpdctl rmctrl lsctrl

  # ftpdctl -v lsctrl
  ftpdctl: adding "lsctrl" to reqargv
  ftpdctl: contacting server
  ftpdctl: sending control request
  ftpdctl: receiving control response
  ftpdctl: access denied
</pre>
The &quot;access denied&quot; message happens because of the special status
of the <code>lsctrl</code> action which keeps it from being disablable.

<p>
<b>Admin Controls</b><br>
The <code>mod_ctrls</code> module, by itself, is rather unexciting.  Other
modules, such as <code>mod_ctrls_admin</code>, provide more interesting
and useful control actions, including:
<ul>
  <li><code>debug</code>
  <li><code>dump</code>
  <li><code>kick</code>
  <li><code>restart</code>
  <li><code>shutdown</code>
  <li><code>start</code>
  <li><code>status</code>
  <li><code>stop</code>
  <li><code>trace</code>
</ul>
These actions provide basic administrative control over the running
<code>proftpd</code> daemon; see the <code>mod_ctrls_admin</code>
<a href="../contrib/mod_ctrls_admin.html">documentation</a> for more details.

<p>
A basic <code>mod_ctrls_admin</code> configuration is:
<pre>
  &lt;IfModule mod_ctrls_admin.c&gt;
    AdminControlsACLs all allow user *
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
will allows anyone to use any <code>mod_ctrls_admin</code> control action.

<p>
Here is another configuration, encompassing both <code>mod_ctrls</code>
and <code>mod_ctrls_admin</code>:
<pre>
  &lt;IfModule mod_ctrls.c&gt;
    ControlsEngine        on
    ControlsACLs          all allow group ftpadm
    ControlsMaxClients    2
    ControlsLog           /var/log/proftpd/controls.log
    ControlsInterval      5
    ControlsSocketACL     allow group ftpadm
    ControlsSocket        /tmp/ctrls.sock
    ControlsSocketOwner   ftpd ftpd

    &lt;IfModule mod_ctrls_admin.c&gt;
      AdminControlsACLs all allow user dave,bob,lisa
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
In this configuration, users <code>dave</code>, <code>bob</code>, and
<code>lisa</code> are allowed to use all of the control actions supplied
by <code>mod_ctrls_admin</code>.  However, unless these users are members
of group <code>ftpadm</code>, access will be denied.  Only group
<code>ftpadm</code> has been allowed access to the <code>mod_ctrls</code>
socket itself by the <code>ControlsSocketACL</code> directive.

<p>
What about configuring an ACL for a given control that includes both
users <i>and</i> groups?  Use:
<pre>
  AdminControlsACLs restart allow user dave,lisa
  AdminControlsACLs restart allow group ftpadm
</pre>
What if user <code>dave</code> is not a member of group <code>ftpadm</code>?
If configured, <b>both</b> user <b>and</b> group ACLs must deny the client.
If either allows access, the client can use that control action.
