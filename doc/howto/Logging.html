<b>Logging</b><br>
Logging the activity of the server is an integral part of effective server
administration.  ProFTPD provides several different and flexing logging
mechanisms.  When examining the different logging mechanisms, have in
mind the intended use of the logged data, the volume of data being logged,
any post-processing that may need to be done, <i>etc</i>.  Log files are more
useful when they contain a complete record of server activity. It is often
easier to simply post-process the log files to remove requests that you do not
want to consider.  

<p>
<b>Security Warning</b><br>
Anyone who can write to the directory where ProFTPD is writing a log file can
almost certainly gain access to the UID that the server is started under, which
is normally <code>root</code>. <b>Do not</b> give people write access to the
directory where the logs are stored without being aware of the consequences:
if the logs directory is writable (by a non-<code>root</code> user), someone
could replace a log file with a symlink to some other system file, and then
<code>root</code> might overwrite that file with arbitrary data. If the log
files themselves are writable (by a non-<code>root</code> user), then someone
may be able to overwrite the log itself with bogus data.

<p>
When opening log files, <code>proftpd</code> will by default log a warning if
the file being opened for logging is in a directory that does not exist, or
is world-writable.  The log file will <b>not</b> be written in world-writable
directories; there are no exceptions.  (If you have configured log files in
your <code>proftpd.conf</code> that are not appearing, check for the warnings
about world-writable directories.)  The <code>proftpd</code> process will also,
by default, log a warning if the file given is a symlink; this symlink check
can be configured via the <a href="../modules/mod_log.html#AllowLogSymlinks"><code>AllowLogSymlinks</code></a> directive.

<p>
In addition, log files may contain information supplied directly by the client,
without escaping. Therefore, it is possible for malicious clients to insert
control-characters in the log files, so care must be taken in dealing with
raw logs.

<p><a name="Syslog"></a>
<b>Unix <code>syslog</code> Logging</b><br>
By default, <code>proftpd</code> will log via <code>syslog(3)</code>, using
the <code>daemon</code> facility (<code>auth</code> for some logging),
at various levels: <code>err</code>, <code>notice</code>, <code>warn</code>,
<code>info</code>, and <code>debug</code> (debugging is done at this syslog
level).  The location of the server's log files in this case is determined by
your <code>/etc/syslog.conf</code> configuration.

<p>
You can fine-tune your <code>proftpd</code>'s syslog-based logging via the
<a href="../modules/mod_core.html#SyslogFacility"><code>SyslogFacility</code></a> and <a href="../modules/mod_core.html#SyslogLevel"><code>SyslogLevel</code></a> directives.

<p><a name="LogFiles"></a>
<b>Log Files</b><br>
There are three main types of logs that a <code>proftpd</code> daemon can
generate: <code>TransferLog</code>, <code>SystemLog</code>, and
<code>ExtendedLog</code>.

<p><a name="TransferLog"></a>
A <a href="../modules/mod_core.html#TransferLog"><code>TransferLog</code></a>
is the most common log kept, recording file transfers.  Its format is described
in the <code>xferlog(5)</code> man page,
also available <a href="http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/doc/xferlog.html">here</a>.

<p><a name="SystemLog"</a>
If the site administrator wants to have <code>proftpd</code> log its messages
to a file rather than going through <code>syslogd</code>, the
<a href="../modules/mod_log.html#SystemLog"><code>SystemLog</code></a>
configuration directive is the one to use.  There is only one such file kept
for the entire daemon.  See the
<a href="../modules/mod_log.html#ServerLog"><code>ServerLog</code></a>
directive for keeping a similar log on a per-vhost basis.  Note that the
<a href="../modules/mod_core.html#DebugLevel"><code>DebugLevel</code></a>
directive only applies to <code>SystemLog</code> files; it does not materially
affect the syslog-based logging messages.

<p><a name="ExtendedLog"></a>
The <a href="../modules/mod_log.html#ExtendedLog"><code>ExtendedLog</code></a>
directive is used to create log files of a very flexible and configurable
format, and to have granular control over what is logged, and when.  The format
of an <code>ExtendedLog</code> is described using the
<a href="../modules/mod_log.html#LogFormat">LogFormat</a> directive.
Multiple <code>ExtendedLogs</code> can be configured, each with a different
<code>LogFormat</code>.

<!-- Add note/chunk about FTP response codes, from RFC959, for ExtendedLog? -->

<p><a name="SyslogVSFileLog">
<b>Use of syslog versus file logging</b><br>
Most sites will choose to have <code>proftpd</code> log via syslog (which is
the default) or to a file (via the <code>SystemLog</code> directive).  In
either case, there is the question of logging <i>verbosity</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
which messages to log.  This verbosity is determined by the
<a href="../modules/mod_core.html#SyslogLevel"><code>SyslogLevel</code></a>
directive.  ProFTPD will log everything by default, meaning that the default
<code>SyslogLevel</code> is effectively <code>debug</code>.  If, however, you
have your <code>proftpd</code> configured to log via syslog, then you
<i>should</i> also check your <code>/etc/syslog.conf</code> file, to see what
additional filtering of log messages is being applied by syslog.  For example,
if <code>/etc/syslog.conf</code> contained something like:
<pre>
  # Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
  *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages
</pre>
then ProFTPD's log messages below the <code>info</code> level would be filtered
out <b>by syslog</b>.  When you are using syslog logging, the
<code>SyslogLevel</code> configuration directive applies only to the proftpd
logging, and does not control the additional syslog filtering.

<p>
For finer-grained control of the <code>debug</code> level log messages, ProFTPD
internally implements different levels for its <code>debug</code> log messages.
Currently ProFTPD has level 1 through level 10 <code>debug</code> messages.
The <a href="../modules/mod_core.html#DebugLevel"><code>DebugLevel</code></a>
directive is used control the verbosity/filtering of these messages.  Since
these different debug levels are purely a ProFTPD convention, the
<code>DebugLevel</code> directive has no effect on syslog logging.  Also, if
your <code>SyslogLevel</code> configuration uses a level higher than
<code>debug</code>, then the <code>DebugLevel</code> configuration will have
no effect &mdash; your <code>debug</code> level messages are already filtered
out by the <code>SyslogLevel</code> filtering.

<p>
The last point to mention is that the
<a href="../modules/mod_core.html#SyslogFacility"><code>SyslogFacility</code></a> directive only applies to syslog logging; it has no effect on file logging.

<p><a name="LogAnalysis"></a>
<b>Log Analysis</b><br>
There are a variety of log analyzers available; these are just a few:
<ul>
  <li>Webalizer: <a href="http://www.webalizer.org/">http://www.webalizer.org/</a>
  <li>HTTP-analyze: <a href="http://www.netstore.de/Supply/http-analyze/">http://www.netstore.de/Supply/http-analyze/</a>

</ul>

<p><a name="LogRotation"></a>
<b>Log Rotation</b><br>
On even a moderately busy server, the quantity of information stored in the log
files is very large.  It will consequently be necessary to periodically rotate
the log files by moving or deleting the existing logs. This cannot be done
while the server is running, because the daemon will continue writing to the
old log file as long as it holds the file open.  Instead, the server must be
<a href="Stopping.html">restarted</a> after the log files are moved or deleted
so that it will open new log files.

<p>
Another way to perform log rotation is using <a href="#FIFOs">FIFOs</a> as
discussed in the next section.

<p><a name="FIFOs"></a>
<b>FIFOs (<i>a.k.a.</i> named pipes)</b><br>
ProFTPD is capable of writing log files to FIFOs, from which another
process can read.  Use of this capability dramatically increases the
flexibility of logging, without adding code to the main server.  In order to
write logs to a pipe, simply create the FIFO at the desired path
(<code>man mkfifo(1)</code>), and use that path in the logging configuration
directive.

<p>
One important use of piped logs is to allow log rotation without having to
restart the server.  One such popular flexible log rotation program is
<a href="http://www.ford-mason.co.uk/resources/cronolog/">cronolog</a>;
however, at present cronolog requires a small patch to enable it to read
from a FIFO (by default, cronolog reads data from stdin).  Please contact
the author of this article for details concerning the patch.

<p>
Here's an example of FIFO-based logging script, based on one posted by Michael
Renner:
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl

  use strict;

  use File::Basename qw(basename);
  use Sys::Syslog qw(:DEFAULT setlogsock);

  my $program = basename($0);

  my $fifo = '/var/log/proftpd-log.fifo';
  my $syslog_facility = 'daemon';
  my $syslog_level = 'info';

  open(FIFO, "&lt; $fifo") or die "$program: unable to open $fifo: $!\n";

  setlogsock 'unix';

  openlog($program, 'pid', $syslog_facility);
  syslog($syslog_level, $_) while (&lt;FIFO&gt;);
  closelog();

  close(FIFO);
  exit 0;
</pre>
More complex filtering can be added to such scripts.  

<p>
If using FIFOs, there are some caveats to keep in mind.  If you use in
<code>init.d</code> script to start <code>standalone</code> daemons, you can
add commands to start the FIFO logging programs first, before the daemon.
For <code>inetd</code>-run servers, consider wrapping up the necessary
commands for starting a FIFO reader and the server into a simple shell
script, or simply run the FIFO-reading program from an <code>init.d</code>
script, and save the overhead of starting that process, in addition to the
<code>proftpd</code> process, for each FTP session.

<p>
FIFO-based log readers are a very powerful tool, but they should not be
used where a simpler solution like off-line post-processing is available.

<p>
<b>Note</b>: In ProFTPD 1.3.3, the code was changed to use nonblocking
<code>open(2)</code> system calls when opening log files.  This was done to
prevent a <code>proftpd</code> process from blocking indefinitely
(<i>i.e.</i> "hanging") if the log file was a FIFO, and there was no FIFO
reader process running when the log file was opened.  However, some sites
<i>do</i> want this blocking open behavior, as their FIFO reader processes
may be temporarily busy.  To get the pre-1.3.3 blocking behavior, you will
need to compile proftpd using the <code>--disable-nonblocking-log-open</code>
configure option.

<p><a name="SQLLogging"></a>
<b>SQL Logging</b><br>
The <code>mod_sql</code> module also enables some powerful and complex
logging capabilities...

<p><a name="TraceLogging"></a>
<b>Trace Logging</b><br>
ProFTPD also supports a much more verbose form of logging called "trace
logging".  This form of logging is covered in greater detail
<a href="Tracing.html">here</a>.

<p><a name="PidFile"></a>
<b>Pid File</b><br>
On startup, <code>proftpd</code> saves the process ID of the parent daemon
process to the file <code>var/proftpd/proftpd.pid</code>. This filename can be
changed with the <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_PidFile.html">PidFile</a> directive. The process ID (<i>aka</i> PID) is for
use by the administrator in restarting and terminating the daemon by sending
signals to the parent process.  For more information see the
<a href="Stopping.html">stopping and starting</a> page.

<p>
<b>Scoreboard File</b><br>
The last type of &quot;logging&quot; is done via the scoreboard file.  The
scoreboard is binary-formatted file the server uses to store information
about each session; it is this file that is read by <code>ftptop</code>,
<code>ftpwho</code> and <code>ftpcount</code>.  The location for the
scoreboard file is determined by the
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_ScoreboardFile.html"><code>ScoreboardFile</code></a> directive.

<p><a name="FAQ"></a>
<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><br>

<p>
<font color=red>Question</font>: How can I direct the <code>TransferLog</code>
logging to syslog?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: It is not currently possible to configure
proftpd to log <code>TransferLog</code> data to syslog.  <b>However</b>, you
<i>can</i> configure an <code>ExtendedLog</code> which logs to syslog, and
which uses a <code>LogFormat</code> to log the data you wish.  For example:
<pre>
  LogFormat xfer "%h %l %u %t\"%r\" %s %b"
  ExtendedLog syslog:notice xfer
</pre>
tells proftpd to log that <code>LogFormat</code> via syslog at the "notice"
syslog level.

<p>
<font color=red>Question</font>: I have <code>SystemLog</code> in my
<code>proftpd.conf</code>, and when I use the <code>SyslogLevel</code> directive
to try to filter the messages which <code>proftpd</code> logs to my
<code>SystemLog</code>, it doesn't work.  Why not?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: When ProFTPD is configured to log everything
to a file via the <code>SystemLog</code> directive, it will do just that:
log <i>everything</i>, without any filtering, regardless of any
<code>SyslogLevel</code> directive.  <b>However</b>, this changed in
ProFTPD 1.3.4rc1: in that release, the <code>SyslogLevel</code> directive was
made to apply to file-based logging as well.

<p>
<font color=red>Question</font>: How can I configure <code>proftpd</code> so
that <b>nothing</b> is logged for certain clients/IP addresses?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: Using a combination of <a href="Classes.html">classes</a> and the <a href="../contrib/mod_ifsession.html"><code>mod_ifsession</code></a> module, this can be done using a configuration like this:
<pre>
  &lt;Class invisible&gt;
    From 1.2.3.4
  &lt;/Class&gt;

  &lt;IfClass invisible&gt;
    # Disable all logging of these clients
    SystemLog none
    ExtendedLog /path/to/ext.log NONE
    TransferLog none
  &lt;/IfClass&gt;
</pre>
