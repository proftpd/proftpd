	* src/main.c: 
	Add a function to free up the memory allocated when moving the
	environment "out of the way" for use by setproctitle() et al;
	valgrind was complaining about this lost memory.  Also free up the
	permanent pool, and the free block list, when the daemon shuts
	down.

2003-09-07 17:53  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth_unix.c: 
	Changing permanent_pool to session.pool where appropriate.  Also
	add a session exit callback that will call endpwent()/endgrent(),
	freeing up any memory that may have been allocated via
	setpwent()/setgrent().	Symmetry is a Good Thing.

2003-09-07 17:51  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth_pam.c: 
	Removed an unnecessary check for a NULL pointer that will be given
	to free(3): the POSIX standard says that free() can handle a NULL
	pointer without choking.  Also, since mod_auth_pam handles the
	password, when the buffer which holds the password is freed, it
	should be scrubbed, rather than just using memset().

2003-09-07 17:42  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	Removing cruft, updating calls to subsystem initializers.

2003-09-07 17:41  castaglia

	* include/dirtree.h, src/dirtree.c: 
	Cleanup.  Fixed some timing and usages of sub pools, particularly
	in get_dir_ctxt().  Changed permanent_pool to be session.pool where
	appropriate.  Changed !strcmp() to be strcmp() == 0, and added some
	checks for paths of zero length (spotted by valgrind).

2003-09-07 17:39  castaglia

	* src/auth.c: 
	Removing cruft.  Also added some comments on the difference between
	the static make_cmd() function in this file, and the public
	pr_cmd_alloc() function.

2003-09-07 17:37  castaglia

	* src/fsio.c: 
	Style cleanup, mostly.	Using strcmp() == 0 rather than !strcmp()
	is a little clearer to most people.  Also fixed a bug where a pool
	was not being destroyed at the proper time.

2003-09-07 17:36  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	Use memcpy() rather than memmove(), as memcpy() is a little more
	efficient (it doesn't have to check the overlapping buffers). 
	Also, allocate one space for one more character, to account for the
	possibility of a LF as the first character in the buffer being
	adjusted (it would then need to be prefaced by a CR).

2003-09-07 17:33  castaglia

	* modules/: mod_auth_file.c, mod_core.c, mod_log.c: 
	Changed uses of permanent_pool to session.pool, as is more
	appropriate in most module code.

2003-09-07 17:32  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c: 
	Changed some uses of permanent_pool here to be session.pool, as is
	more appropriate in most module code.

2003-09-07 17:31  castaglia

	* include/modules.h, src/modules.c: 
	Removing cruft.  The call_module_auth() and call_module_cmd()
	functions were duplicates of call_module(), so there is no need to
	keep them around.  Also fixed some of the pools being used when
	adding symbols to the stash.  Fixed a bug where the stash pool was
	not being properly allocated from permanent_pool (valgrind found
	this).

2003-09-07 17:29  castaglia

	* include/pool.h, src/pool.c: 
	Cleaning up the pool interface.  The pr_ prefix for initializing
	the pool code, as many of the subsystem initializers are not meant
	to be called by module code; the pr_ suffix is meant to denote the
	API for use by module authors.	Also fixed a possible
	alarm-blocking bug in destroy_pool().

2003-09-07 17:26  castaglia

	* include/inet.h, src/inet.c: 
	Removing cruft.  The iplist/niplist members of the conn_t struct
	were not being used anymore.  Also removed some unnecessary
	complexities (a macro, a cleanup handler).

2003-09-07 17:25  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_ratio.c: 
	Removing some cruft from the source code, which involves removing
	mod_ratio's use of one of the crufty functions.

2003-09-07 16:55  castaglia

	* modules/mod_cap.c:

	POSIX capabilities.

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_sql.c: 
	Bug#2154 - SQL query loses shell information.

2003-09-06 10:44  castaglia

	* modules/mod_ls.c: 
	Another leak fixed.  In this case, listdir() was (inappropriately)
	setting pointers in the array--allocated and returned by
	sreaddir()--to NULL.  Those pointers were allocated using calloc()
	in sreaddir(), which meant that later, when listdir() went to free
	the memory, it couldn't -- the address was lost.  All better now.

2003-09-06 09:56  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	Fixing subtle off-by-one bug (thank you valgrind!).

2003-09-05 13:00  castaglia

	* src/pool.c: 
	Rename xmalloc, xcalloc, and xrealloc to be smalloc, scalloc, and
	srealloc ("s" for "safe", just like sstrncpy and sstrcat).  This
	moves these functions out of the way of dmalloc's symbols (and
	doesn't hurt proftpd at all).

2003-09-05 12:42  castaglia

	* include/conf.h: 
	Add conditional include for <dmalloc.h>, for use when using dmalloc
	to track memory usage.

	itself.

	* include/bindings.h, include/dirtree.h, src/bindings.c: 
	Add comments about the duplicate

	correct the patch for Bug#2146 so that ib_server->listen is still
	handled properly (as it prior to the patch) in the Bindings API.

2003-08-29 10:01  castaglia

	* NEWS, include/bindings.h, src/bindings.c: 
	Bug#2146 - DNS names not handled properly when --enable-ipv6 is
	used.  As mentioned in the report, this was caused by a design
	assumption revealed by the addition of IPv6 support: that of a
	one-to-one association between a server_rec and its listening
	connection.  For DNS names resolving to A and AAAA records, there
	can be two listening connections for a given server_rec.  The fix
	occurs in the Bindings API, where a server_rec's listeners are now
	associated with the bindings for the server_rec, rather than with
	the server_rec itself.	Multiple bindings can point to the same
	server_rec.

2003-08-28 23:33  castaglia

	* src/netaddr.c: 
	Using uninitialized memory can be bad.

	IP_TOS may be a problem on IPv6 connections...

	Using mod_sql for authentication, but not configuring a

	concerning the problem.

2003-08-14 18:33  castaglia

	* NEWS, contrib/mod_ifsession.c: 
	Fixed mod_ifsession's handling of multiple configuration sets.	The
	problem was that mod_ifsession, after merging in the configuration
	from a config_rec, would call xaset_remove() and remove that
	config_rec from the main server's configuration sets.  This had the
	side effect of making other config_recs in the set, in the set
	after the removed config_rec, no longer visible by the iterating
	function.  As in Perl: don't change the items in a list while
	iterating over it.  Instead, queue up the changes you want to make
	while iterating, wait until finished iterating, and then change the
	list.

	(which allows a more Apache-like handling of badly configured

	became possible where, after looping through all the server_recs,

	ExtendedLog/SQLLog, which might want to use %f for RNTO, the path
	allocated from that pool would be gone.  Now, a LOG_CMD/LOG_CMD_ERR

	* NEWS, include/bindings.h, src/bindings.c, src/main.c: 
	Fixed minor fd leak/messiness where listening fds were not being
	properly closed in a session process, when the session is first
	starting.  Michael noticed symptoms of this manifesting as a
	problem handling HUPs.	(I can't believe this behavior has gone on
	for so long in the code with no one noticing...oh well).

	Adding more stuff to the --enable-devel option: first, the ability
	to generate core dumps (thank you, Michael!) Second, the ability to
	specify developer options in the configure --enable-devel
	parameter, rather than using CFLAGS.  For example, rather than
	doing:
	
	  CFLAGS="-DPR_DEVEL_NO_FORK -DPR_DEVEL_COREDUMP" ./configure
	--enable-devel ...
	
	you can now do:
	
	  ./configure --enable-devel=nofork:coredump ...
	
	At present, only three developer options are supported: nodaemon,
	nofork, and coredump.

	* src/scoreboard.c: 
	Be a little more careful about interrupted system calls.  In some

	In others, we simply block all signals that might interrupt the

2003-03-24 12:26  castaglia

	* modules/mod_auth.c, src/main.c, src/scoreboard.c,

	Fixing the messages reported when opening the scoreboard (and
	making all such messages consistent).
	
	Note: we'll need to document, probably in the release announcement,
	when the scoreboard format (include/scoreboard.h's
	PR_SCOREBOARD_VERSION) is increment.  For standalone-run daemons,
	there is no problem; for inetd-run daemons, though, the old
	scoreboard file will need to be deleted before the new daemon is
	started, else the new daemon will complain of the scoreboard being
	too old.  (I think this is what we are seeing now with people
	upgrading from 1.2.7 to 1.2.8; it's the first time in who knows how
	long that the scoreboard version number was increment.)

	* NEWS: 
	Should mention mod_radius changes here.

2003-03-20 22:44  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_radius.c: 
	Changing way mod_radius looks up custom attributes in response
	packets; now, rather than using RADIUS attribute type IDs,
	mod_radius will use VSA IDs.  The new RadiusVendor directive is
	used to configure the vendor for which mod_radius will search.	The
	new RadiusGroupInfo complements the existing RadiusUserInfo
	directive; as expected, RadiusGroupInfo is used to configure RADIUS
	user group membership information.

	Making the checking of the configuration file path actually work.
	
	Getting rid of #PR_HACK_DISABLE_MEM_VHOST_FREE, and commenting out
	the freeing code completely.  Copy-on-write semantics means that
	that freeing of memory, which would not be used or changed anyway,
	probably adds load unnecessarily.  I doubt anyone will miss that

	Modifying the checking of configuration paths slightly.  Rather
	than now only accepting absolute paths (criterion: string begins
	with '/'), paths that start with any of the paths registered with
	the FSIO layer will be accepted.  This allows FSIO modules to
	register handlers for paths that may not necessarily be local

	* include/fsio.h, src/fsio.c: 
	Changing a few of the FSIO functions (close, read, write, lseek) so
	that they operate on file handles, rather than on filesystem
	objects.  This is done primarily so that they can get access to the
	newly-added fh_data member of a file handle, used for storing
	file-specific data.
	
	Also added two new FSIO functions, for fstat and ftruncate.

	functions.  Hrmf.

	* modules/mod_auth.c: 
	Change the timing of when C_USER is removed from the config tree;

	* src/main.c: 
	Oops.  Had these function calls, for running through the registered

2003-03-08 19:09  castaglia

	* include/modules.h, src/main.c, src/modules.c: 
	Adding yet another module callback registration set of functions. 
	This set is for allowing modules to register callbacks that are
	invoked just before the daemon starts up, after it has (possibly)
	daemonized.  One would want to have something done at this point
	when you want to make sure that the daemon process is affected,
	e.g. adding a timer.  Calling alarm(3) in a module_init function
	won't work for standalone daemons, for part of the daemonizing
	process involves forking() twice (to dissociate the process
	completely from the terminal), and all pending alarms are cleared
	for a child process.

2003-03-08 18:25  castaglia

	* NEWS: 
	Making note of new handling/checking for IP address/port
	collisions.

2003-03-08 18:24  castaglia

	* modules/mod_core.c: 
	This patch prevents two specific vhost misconfigurations: 1) trying
	to use "0.0.0.0", which no client could ever reach, and 2) IP
	address/port collisions.  The second is the more likely of the
	misconfigurations, particularly when DNS names, rather than IP
	addresses, are used in <VirtualHost> lines (as when new proftpd
	uses think to configure name-based vhosts).

2003-03-06 09:48  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql_postgres.c: 
	Postgres added a string-escaping function at some point, so just as
	mod_sql_mysql does, now mod_sql_postgres will make use of its
	library-provided function.
	
	Note that a manual #define had to be used, to ensure backward
	compatibility with Postgres installations that don't have the
	escape function.  Ideally a configure script could check for the
	function; this is yet another case for having proftpd's build
	system support per-module build directories and scripts.

2003-03-04 11:55  castaglia

	* contrib/mod_sql.c, include/modules.h, src/modules.c: 
	Formalizing the use of "hooks", which are custom cmdtable entries
	that contrib modules can add.  mod_sql started the trend with its
	"sql_lookup" and "sql_change" hooks.  This patch makes sure that
	any such hooks will not be accidentally used; it was possible, if a
	custom hook was entered that has an all uppercase name, for a
	client to send an FTP command that matched that name, leading to a
	possible bad interaction.
	
	This patch avoids the above scenario by defining a new symbol tag,
	PR_SYM_HOOK, to be used for "hook" cmdtable entries.  I'll add
	documentation about this in the Developer's Guide as appropriate.

	Forgot to mention tcp{Receive,Send}Window fix in NEWS.

2003-01-13 11:20  castaglia

	* src/data.c: 
	Fixing the timing of setting of socket options.  The
	tcpReceiveWindow and tcpSendWindow configuration directives were
	not taking effect properly because setsockopt(2) was being called,
	for the data connection, _after_ the TCP handshake was done.  As it
	is during the handshake when such things as window sizes are
	negotiated, this timing rendered any configuration settings
	useless.

2003-01-13 10:25  castaglia

	* src/main.c: 
	As John pointed out, it's better to have run-time generated files,
	much like coredumps, to be under RUN_DIR (/var/run/proftpd), or
	CORE_DIR (although CORE_DIR is #defined to be RUN_DIR).  So now,
	the profiling gmon.out and bb.out files will be found there, rather
	than /tmp.
	
	Thanks, John! =)

2003-01-12 21:38  castaglia

	* Make.rules.in, modules/mod_core.c, src/main.c: 
	Added DEVEL_NO_DAEMON define, and changed other DEBUG_* defines to
	match.	The purpose for these is to be able to build a proftpd
	daemon that can be profiled.  Now, one can have a configure
	statement such as:
	
	  CFLAGS="-DDEVEL_NO_DAEMON -DDEVEL_NO_FORK -g -pg -a" \
	    LIBS="-pg" ./configure ...
	
	The resulting daemon will only handle one session.  The bb.out and
	gmon.out profiling files will be written to /tmp.

	The distinction for which I am striving is to have all the
	functions that module developers should use to be prefixed with
	pr_; public functions may be available without a pr_ prefix, but
	such functions will be intended for use by the core code only.
	
	Also, more in the RFC2228 support department:
	
	  session_t has a new field, rfc2228_mech.  This is to be filled in
	by
	  the RFC2228 module that handles an AUTH command, so that other
	  RFC2228 modules, should they be higher in the module load order,
	know
	  not to process RFC2228 commands meant for the handling module.
	
	  The response formatting callback function now takes an additional
	  parameter, a pool pointer, as the first argument.  The pool that
	will
	  be passed to that function will be the same pool used by the
	other
	  response functions.

	Just to note: a lot of the warnings generated by mod_tls
	(specifically, by the OpenSSL files #include'd by mod_tls) cannot
	be fixed by us.  Quite a few of the warnings are about function
	prototypes; the OpenSSL developers don't have complete prototype

	* src/dirtree.c: 
	In tracking down an unrelated bug last night, I discovered that, at
	present, proftpd's parser will gladly handle empty contexts, such
	as when:
	
	  <Directory blah>
	  </Directory>
	
	or
	
	  <Global>
	  </Global>
	
	appear in the configuration file.  These empty sets are useless,
	and serve only to use up memory unnecessarily; that memory usage is
	compounded when directives are merged down into these sets.
	
	This patch checks for such empty contexts (in end_sub_config()),
	and removes them from the configuration tree.

	Returning ERROR from an auth handler (specifically, in an "auth" or

	looks for negative values.  So, to handle this case, I've added
	PR_AUTH_ERROR return value (-1) for auth handlers that encounter

	* include/options.h, lib/glibc-glob.c: 
	These changes make it possible to tune the maximum number of
	recursion levels supported when globbing.  A better way of dealing
	with possible DoS attacks via globbing is via the RLimit*
	directives, or to disable globbing support altogether by using the
	UseGlobbing directive.	However, in some cases it may be necessary
	to support globbing, but to do so in as restrictive a manner as
	possible.
	
	The default maximum number of levels supported by GNU's globbing is
	8.  This patch keeps that default, but allows the administrator, if
	need be, to tune that level lower by means of the
	PR_TUNABLE_GLOBBING_MAX macro, defined in include/options.h.  When
	compiling proftpd, it can be defined to some lower value, e.g.:

	* src/auth.c: 
	Fixed a bad bug, introduced with the Cygwin changes (I think). 
	setgid() will not be called if the platform doesn't have
	setgroups() due to the placement of the HAVE_SETGROUPS #ifdefs.  I
	don't know if this change will break stuff under Cygwin, but the
	current placement of those #ifdefs won't do.

	* NEWS, modules/mod_core.c: 
	Fixed typo in NEWS Added handler for ScoreboardPath directive,
	which will report on the  deprecated nature of the directive, and
	inform the admin of using the  newer ScoreboardFile instead. 
	Hopefully this will help ease (somewhat)  the upgrade to 1.2.7.

2002-10-15 10:01  castaglia

	* include/proftpd.h, modules/mod_xfer.c, src/data.c: 
	Removing some cruft from session.xfer, fixing some whitespace
	styling.  Significant change is moving session.xfer.path so that it
	is not allocated from session.xfer.p (a pool with a bad name =P),
	but rather is the string originally allocated in the PRE_CMD
	handler, from cmd->pool.  There is no reason for the path to be
	reallocated again from session.xfer.p (unless any functions
	manipulate that buffer, which they shouldn't, and which none
	currently do), and, in some cases, ASCII CRLF handling was causing
	corruption of that buffer.

	struct's pool member.  That way, the sched_t object can be

	download from CVS, and run ./configure && make,      the make
	program's check of the timestamp on configure.in shows an     
	earlier date on configure.in than on configure (if both
	configure.in and      configure are checked into CVS
	simultaneously, they will have the same      timestamps, and make
	will cause the configure script to be run again).      What a pain.
